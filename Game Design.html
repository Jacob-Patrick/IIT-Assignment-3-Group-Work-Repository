				<h3 style=color:#090b85; > The idea of scenes and settings with choice mechanics that are affected by the Amilia’s demon.  </h3>
				
				<br>
				<li><b> What to expect </b></li>
				<p> For example, there would be a scene where the protagonist would be met with a relatively simple choice. Say they could be being asked to complete a rather menial task such as whether they would help a relative go to the local supermarket and pick up some groceries. While this would be a simple task asked of the protagonist early on in the game, the player would be met with the option of saying yes or no. However, before this option is presented to the player, the Demon would interject and start going through the list of potential issues that could arise. These would include “there will be a lot of people there, so it would be busy and crowded”; “People there won’t want to see you, honestly, who does?”; "You might get hit by a bus, actually, that might not be so bad!” and so on. It would be a list that would otherwise not matter to most people. However, to the protagonist this would cause anxiety to start seeping in, and when the player is finally presented with the option of “yes” or “no” they are suddenly loaded. No matter the option selected, “no” will be what is selected.  </p>
				<p> This is all built up to offer a sense of control to the player, that is in actual fact, nothing more than a farce. The idea is that this will start creating a rift between the protagonist and their family that will only continue to worsen throughout the experience.   </p>
				<p> As time goes on, the demon becomes more influential and controlling. Any sense of control the player has, will slowly but shortly be taken away.   </p>
