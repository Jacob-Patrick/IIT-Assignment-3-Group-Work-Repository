[12/9/20, 10:56:36 am] Jacob: Gday muzz...
[12/9/20, 10:56:46 am] Jacob: How are you guys going with assignment 1?
[12/9/20, 11:12:30 am] Jordon O’Meara: Im still stuck on the project idea. I just have no idea.
[12/9/20, 11:14:36 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning all
[12/9/20, 11:15:09 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea i’ve started on assignment 1, but not to say that im 100% on top of it all
[12/9/20, 11:15:57 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to be finishing of the weekly investigative submission first and then focus on the assignment
[12/9/20, 11:16:21 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m doing a interactive nursery rhyme
[12/9/20, 11:16:30 am] Sneha RMIT: Not sure if that’ll work
[12/9/20, 11:30:17 am] Jacob: I’ve completed most of the assignment 1 stuff except the project idea and my personality test discussion....I’m worried that I’ll fall behind on the other stuff while stressing about this!
[12/9/20, 11:30:34 am] Jacob: I think we’ll be right as long as we answer the questions
[12/9/20, 11:30:48 am] Jacob: And I think a nursery rhyme is a good idea Sneha
[12/9/20, 11:31:57 am] Jacob: Is everybody doing intro to programming as well?
[12/9/20, 11:33:10 am] Sneha RMIT: Sorry my bad got confused for a second. Yea doing both intro to IT and intro to programming
[12/9/20, 11:33:54 am] Sneha RMIT: Haven’t started the assignment 1 yet. But I come from a psychology background and im also leaning towards a personality test
[12/9/20, 11:53:10 am] Murray: I’ve done my personal profile and gonna finish off the other stuff this weekend fingers crossed. No idea yet about the project idea lol.

I’m doing prog as well 👍
[12/9/20, 12:54:10 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: luckily i  completed Assignment 1 PDF documentation. now i need to start create webpages and GitHub push and all
[12/9/20, 12:54:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: well done..   yaa hooo
[12/9/20, 12:55:23 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: great jpb !👏👏
[12/9/20, 12:57:02 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Dont worry , Jac... its okey for slow and steady. we will do our best in this weekend 💪
[15/9/20, 2:15:26 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Hows everyone going?
Im still really struggling for a project idea. Especially one I can write 1000 words about 😬
[15/9/20, 2:26:47 pm] Jacob: Hey Jordan, I found it easier once I set out my sections, It’s not so daunting when you just have to write 100 words here and there.
[15/9/20, 2:29:25 pm] Jacob: I also just smashed out dot points and expanded on them to get the word count
[15/9/20, 2:57:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah that's true. Planning to have the content done by tonight. So ill give that a shot
[15/9/20, 3:00:51 pm] Jacob: Yeah that’s my aim too, good luck man
[15/9/20, 3:07:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: You too
[16/9/20, 3:54:26 am] Jordon O’Meara: Done and submitted. If you guys need any help let me know
[16/9/20, 3:54:53 am] Sneha RMIT: Hey jordan
[16/9/20, 3:54:59 am] Sneha RMIT: Good on you
[16/9/20, 3:55:08 am] Sneha RMIT: Im working on it now as well
[16/9/20, 3:55:15 am] Sneha RMIT: A bit confused though
[16/9/20, 3:55:26 am] Jordon O’Meara: Anything I can help you with?
[16/9/20, 3:56:05 am] Sneha RMIT: So what do we do with the html pages we create through notepad
[16/9/20, 3:56:19 am] Sneha RMIT: Are we meant to then upload it onto github
[16/9/20, 3:57:29 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah so I just watched one of the videos Anthony put up. And he walks you though it.

Ill find the link
[16/9/20, 3:57:51 am] Jordon O’Meara: https://tinyurl.com/githubtutes
[16/9/20, 3:57:58 am] Jordon O’Meara: The second video.
[16/9/20, 3:58:05 am] Sneha RMIT: Oh thanks
[16/9/20, 3:58:29 am] Jordon O’Meara: One tip.
Make sure any of the HTML files you upload are all lower-case in the file name
[16/9/20, 3:58:41 am] Jordon O’Meara: I have a few capitals and nothing worked until I fixed it
[16/9/20, 3:58:43 am] Sneha RMIT: What did you end up deciding on the project idea
[16/9/20, 3:58:57 am] Sneha RMIT: Ah ok
[16/9/20, 3:59:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Cool
[16/9/20, 3:59:07 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks for the heads up 😊
[16/9/20, 4:00:06 am] Sneha RMIT: Im thinking of a app like airtasker, except that people can also advertise their skill set, instead of people just posting jobs they want done
[16/9/20, 4:00:36 am] Jordon O’Meara: Thats really cool.
[16/9/20, 4:01:21 am] Jordon O’Meara: I ended up doing an app to stop procrastination by having another random user tell you to do it so that you are accountable to somebody ha
[16/9/20, 4:01:37 am] Sneha RMIT: Like for example programming tutors can advertise their skill set and set their own starting prices as well
[16/9/20, 4:01:44 am] Sneha RMIT: Haha love it
[16/9/20, 4:01:56 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah that's a good idea
[16/9/20, 4:01:56 am] Sneha RMIT: I think i would need that
[16/9/20, 4:02:13 am] Sneha RMIT: Alright thanks. Have a nice morning
[16/9/20, 4:02:20 am] Sneha RMIT: 😊
[16/9/20, 4:02:57 am] Jordon O’Meara: Thanks. I'm gonna try get some sleep. Planning to do my intro to programming assignment tomorrow. Gonna be a long day ha
[16/9/20, 4:03:24 am] Sneha RMIT: I start work at 8am 😅
[16/9/20, 4:03:32 am] Jordon O’Meara: Oof
[16/9/20, 4:03:47 am] Sneha RMIT: Good luck with it. Let us know how you go with that one
[16/9/20, 4:03:50 am] Jordon O’Meara: Luckily a day off for me
[16/9/20, 4:04:01 am] Sneha RMIT: Enjoy
[16/9/20, 2:12:48 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all - I finished preparing assignment PDF , webpages and all - needs to upload the files to GitHub 🙌
[16/9/20, 2:21:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jordan , Sneha , Jacob , Murray and Ben... let’s finish this task on or before Friday 🙏🏼
[16/9/20, 2:22:23 pm] Jordon O’Meara: If anyone needs help with github or submitting. Just ask. Happy to help if you're unsure
[16/9/20, 2:27:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jordan
[16/9/20, 2:31:11 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I definitely will ask
[16/9/20, 3:55:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks guys. Hopefully finish mine tonight
[16/9/20, 4:00:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: What information did you include or exclude on the website
[16/9/20, 4:00:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Did you create a webpage for project idea
[16/9/20, 4:00:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Or just put that information on the pdf
[16/9/20, 4:02:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah everything on the website. I did separate pages for everything and linked between them. But I believe you could just do one full page.

I was a bit confused cause i was under the impression the pdf should have everything on it.

But I double checked it Anthony and all you need is name. Student number and links to github and github pages.

Everythjbg else is on the website
[16/9/20, 4:03:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok great
[16/9/20, 4:03:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[16/9/20, 4:13:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Well done Sneha
‎[16/9/20, 4:13:36 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted
[16/9/20, 4:17:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yay thanks 😄
[16/9/20, 4:54:59 pm] Jacob: Hey guys I just finished work, good job with the assignments everybody! I finished my PDF yesterday too and then worked through the github video, so now I just need to transfer my info to HTML and upload
[16/9/20, 4:55:42 pm] Jacob: I should be able to get it done by Friday but I haven’t even thought about the programming assignment yet!
[16/9/20, 4:56:04 pm] Jacob: I have Saturday, Sunday and Monday off work so should be alright
[16/9/20, 4:58:48 pm] Murray: Don’t worry Jake I’m in the same boat! Should have it don’t by Friday the can think about programming on the weekend haha.

Its always fun trying to sneak in uni work around my job! But I’m sure I’m not the only one.

Great job guys!
[16/9/20, 4:59:20 pm] Murray: I think by the time we get to the group assignment we will all be pros
[16/9/20, 4:59:34 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Definitely
[16/9/20, 5:17:34 pm] Jacob: Yeah we got this!
[16/9/20, 5:49:18 pm] Jacob: I just read back a bit, Jordan are you sure about not including the assignment content on the PDF? I was under the impression that everything goes on both
[16/9/20, 5:50:17 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I thought that too. But Anthony said you don't need to.

I might include it just in case though
‎[16/9/20, 5:51:39 pm] Jacob: ‎image omitted
[16/9/20, 5:52:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah maybe will do both then
[16/9/20, 5:52:57 pm] Jacob: I think he mentioned there is like a comment section where you need to upload the doc and to include those details there
[16/9/20, 5:53:01 pm] Jacob: If that makes sense
[17/9/20, 1:26:02 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi guys, pls help,
We just wanna push all html file to GitHub and mentions the links in PDF, isn’t it?
[17/9/20, 1:26:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Or do we need to design webpages through GitHub?
[17/9/20, 1:27:40 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I did all my html coding via notepad only. It’s working perfectly
[17/9/20, 1:28:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey Raj, i’ve done the same. Just using notepad. I think it should be fine to upload that onto Github
[17/9/20, 1:29:38 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Sneha 🙏🏼 I got made 🤣
[17/9/20, 1:29:53 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah as long as it's all on github and works then you're all good
[17/9/20, 1:31:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jordan. I managed to upload the files , everything on GitHub. 🤝🤝
[18/9/20, 12:49:30 am] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys, im stuck. For some weird reason my css file is not being recognised
[18/9/20, 12:49:40 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m seeing a error message
‎[18/9/20, 12:49:46 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[18/9/20, 12:50:30 am] Jordon O’Meara: Can't help you there. I kept it simple and stuck to HTML.
[18/9/20, 12:51:05 am] Sneha RMIT: Lol might be have to end up doing that
[18/9/20, 12:51:09 am] Jacob: Yeah I just did HTML as well sorry!
[18/9/20, 12:51:32 am] Sneha RMIT: Creating too many dramas this way it seems
[18/9/20, 12:51:35 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks guys
[18/9/20, 12:52:35 am] Jacob: I just finished my HTML then and uploaded to GitHub it feels good!
[18/9/20, 12:53:05 am] Sneha RMIT: Good stuff 😊
[18/9/20, 12:53:07 am] Jordon O’Meara: Woo. Nice to get through it
[18/9/20, 11:54:57 pm] Murray: Wow the HTML stuff took longer than I thought. Finally submitted. :)
[18/9/20, 11:55:04 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Congrats!
[18/9/20, 11:56:39 pm] Jacob: Nice, good work!
[18/9/20, 11:58:24 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Great job 👏👏
[19/9/20, 12:05:18 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I submitted both assignments... haa hooo
[19/9/20, 12:07:51 am] Jacob: Well done Raj, I’m going to submit my IT one and then work on my programming one, I have sat, sun and mon free to do it!
[19/9/20, 12:08:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Awesome, Jacob
[19/9/20, 12:21:48 am] Murray: Well don’t mate!
[19/9/20, 12:22:11 am] Murray: I’m the same as Jake haha. I’m gonna worry about starting prog tomorrow lol
[19/9/20, 12:22:53 am] Jacob: Yeah hopefully it’s enough time!
[19/9/20, 12:24:32 am] Murray: Yea nah we’ll be right 🙏
[19/9/20, 1:00:20 am] Rajaneesh Nair: You guys are really genius... wont take much time to finish tasks ... I take plenty of time to finish these tasks ..
[19/9/20, 1:01:38 am] Jordon O’Meara: Oof programming is taking some time. I was gonna stay up and get it done now but might do it in the morning before work.
[19/9/20, 1:01:48 am] Jordon O’Meara: Just gotta do the user guide parr
[19/9/20, 1:01:50 am] Jordon O’Meara: Part
[19/9/20, 1:02:25 am] Rajaneesh Nair: spending minimum of 5-6 hrs to catch up your speed!
[19/9/20, 1:03:01 am] Jacob: How long do you reckon you spent on it so far Jordan?
‎[19/9/20, 1:06:42 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted
[19/9/20, 1:08:33 am] Jacob: Haha I will feel like that after this weekend!!
[19/9/20, 1:09:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Ha ha 🤣
[19/9/20, 1:09:14 am] Jordon O’Meara: I know I've definitely spent over 5 or 6 hrs I think.
But most of that was figuring things out and trying things. I could probably redo it in one hour.
Actually I don't know if I will take long to do the user guide I might aswell do it now.
Im working all weekend so I should try get as much done as I can
[19/9/20, 1:09:54 am] Jordon O’Meara: I haven't done the modules for either subject yet.

Or the IIE for programming.
Assignments have been the priority
[19/9/20, 1:10:09 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Wow.. Good one Jordan 👏
[19/9/20, 1:10:46 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Same here Jordan
[19/9/20, 1:11:09 am] Jacob: Yeah fair enough! I think I’ll do the iie quickly first because I’m not really up with if statements
[19/9/20, 1:12:44 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, in planning to search some YouTube videos for tips and tricks
[19/9/20, 1:13:09 am] Jacob: Good idea Raj I’ll do that
[19/9/20, 1:13:21 am] Jacob: I ordered the text book too but it hasn’t arrived
[19/9/20, 1:13:21 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Java’s eating my brain 🤩
[19/9/20, 1:13:27 am] Jacob: Haha
[19/9/20, 1:13:39 am] Jordon O’Meara: If statements are pretty straight forward once you get used to it.

Just copy and paste an if statement and then change things.

Thats what I did
[19/9/20, 1:14:13 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh Jordan... that’s awesome... will save time
[19/9/20, 1:14:39 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I got the book yesterday
[19/9/20, 1:15:03 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll try that
[19/9/20, 1:15:09 am] Jacob: Yeah cool.....did you take all the inputs at once and then out put a story? Or is it like question/answer, new question/answer
[19/9/20, 1:15:19 am] Jordon O’Meara: I've found that just playing around with things in Java has helped me a lot
[19/9/20, 1:15:27 am] Jordon O’Meara: I did like a question and answer type thing
[19/9/20, 1:15:45 am] Jordon O’Meara: Like ask for a name and an age and then printed those things in a sentence
[19/9/20, 1:16:32 am] Jacob: Oh yeah cool that’s how I was hoping to make mine too
[19/9/20, 1:16:54 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes 🙂
[19/9/20, 1:17:31 am] Jacob: Well I’m keen to get started tomorrow, so I’m off to sleep, goodnight guys
[19/9/20, 1:18:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good night, Jacob, Jordan  and all ... enjoy your weekend 😊
[19/9/20, 1:19:50 am] Jordon O’Meara: Night all
[19/9/20, 10:22:04 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys, just read the chain of messages. Good on you Muzzyn for finally getting it submitted. I was meant to finish of last night but I got too exhausted and fell asleep 😅 back onto it this morning i guess
[19/9/20, 10:23:18 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning Sneha... 🤣 same here. Finished all activities yesterday itself and waken up just now 😃
‎[19/9/20, 10:23:51 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted

[19/9/20, 10:27:29 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I have plenty of time -21 covid19 cases reported in my office and clossed since April !
[19/9/20, 10:27:49 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 😌
[19/9/20, 10:28:16 am] Jacob: Morning guys! Me too too....coffee...computer...good luck with the assignments today
[19/9/20, 10:28:39 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Morning - morning Jacob 🤩
[19/9/20, 10:28:45 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning jake
[19/9/20, 10:28:49 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Keep going
[19/9/20, 12:42:26 pm] Jacob: Does anybody know what the GTerm method “clear” is?
[19/9/20, 12:43:36 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Gt.clear;()
[19/9/20, 12:43:48 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Gt.clear(); I mean
[19/9/20, 12:44:10 pm] Jacob: What does it do though?
[19/9/20, 12:44:23 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Clears the page basicallt
[19/9/20, 12:44:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Makes it a blank page
[19/9/20, 12:44:43 pm] Jacob: Oh right, thanks!
[19/9/20, 12:49:03 pm] Jacob: That made everything so much better
[19/9/20, 12:49:18 pm] Jordon O’Meara: 👍
[20/9/20, 3:03:30 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi guys ,

[20/9/20, 3:27:46 pm] Murray: Try src/alien.jpg
[20/9/20, 3:28:14 pm] Murray: (“src/alien.jpg”)
[20/9/20, 3:28:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Good on you guys. I haven’t been able to complete everything yet. My kids have been a handful. But weekends are like that at our house
[20/9/20, 3:28:48 pm] Jacob: Genius! Thanks muz!
[20/9/20, 3:29:06 pm] Murray: I had the same problem haha. Was doing my head in
[20/9/20, 3:29:37 pm] Murray: Must be stressful!
[20/9/20, 3:30:11 pm] Jacob: That’s tough Sneha, do you still work full time as well?

[20/9/20, 3:31:17 pm] Jacob: Crikey! Wow what a good effort
[20/9/20, 3:32:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Same here, Jac ... struggled a lot but found so much fun
[20/9/20, 3:32:47 pm] Jacob: Yeah I’m really enjoying it!
[20/9/20, 3:33:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Good on you guys 👌⭐️
[20/9/20, 3:33:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great stuff
[20/9/20, 3:36:13 pm] Jacob: Does anyone know a way to gt.clear everything except your image? So like the writing changes but the image remains?
[20/9/20, 3:36:55 pm] Murray: Nah I’m not sure. Only way I can think is maybe run the same code again after the clear?
[20/9/20, 3:37:13 pm] Murray: Maybe as a work around lol. There’s probably a nicer way to do it haha
[20/9/20, 3:38:02 pm] Jacob: Yeah that’s probably the only option now isn’t it cause we haven’t been taught Another way
[20/9/20, 3:38:39 pm] Jacob: I’ll just add it after each gt.clear
[20/9/20, 8:54:42 pm] Jacob: Hey Muz....according to the assignment doc we should not include folder names when adding images....just use the file name....so you need to drag and drop the image straight to the main project folder and then you can just use the file name
[20/9/20, 9:01:06 pm] Murray: Ohhh
[20/9/20, 9:01:34 pm] Murray: Good spot! I’ll sort that out. Thank you!
[20/9/20, 9:02:26 pm] Jacob: No worries!
[20/9/20, 9:10:09 pm] Murray: All fixed. Thanks again for the save haha.
[20/9/20, 9:11:50 pm] Jacob: No worries, you helped me get an image in there in the first place!
[21/9/20, 11:33:50 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys, can you please help me out. I struggled to upload my files on github yesterday.
[21/9/20, 11:55:06 am] Jacob: Hey Sneha what went wrong?
[21/9/20, 11:57:05 am] Jacob: I have GitHub linked to my atom notepad and uploaded it all through there, so I mayb be able to help if you are doing it that way, but I’m not really sure how to do it via the website
[21/9/20, 12:02:55 pm] Murray: Hey Sneha, in one of these videos (I think it’s the shorter one) Andrew goes through the process. I was confused at first as well but when he goes through it it’s actually quite straight forward. Pretty much drag and drop.
[21/9/20, 4:09:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey so sorry got caught up at work
[21/9/20, 4:10:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve created the repository and dragged my files into that folder
[21/9/20, 4:10:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: But i dont dont know what i need to do next
[21/9/20, 4:12:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Have you watched the videos muz linked above?
[21/9/20, 4:12:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think so
[21/9/20, 4:12:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: There were a couple of videos
[21/9/20, 4:13:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m at work now so not being able to see them but i’ll go home and check them all out again
[21/9/20, 4:13:31 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah go through them when you can. I think it will help
[21/9/20, 4:13:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks Jordan
[21/9/20, 4:29:26 pm] Murray: Also just an FYI, Gayan made an announcement and the due date has been moved to next Monday.
[21/9/20, 4:29:35 pm] Murray: So no rush anymore haha.
[21/9/20, 4:36:36 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Thats for programming not for the IT one though
[21/9/20, 4:36:48 pm] Murray: Very true!!
[21/9/20, 4:36:59 pm] Murray: Sorry I’m getting confused by them.
[21/9/20, 5:26:59 pm] Jordon O’Meara: So is the whole group here?
[21/9/20, 5:27:39 pm] Jacob: You know I was wondering that too Jordan, I think Ben is not here
[21/9/20, 5:28:54 pm] Ben: Actually damn good timing in the message there Jake.
Sorry for being MIA all, WhatsApp was not something my phone showed me notifications for as I used it for old work stuff.
So I literally jumped in and started reading back a few minutes ago!
[21/9/20, 5:29:15 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ha I just sent you a message on canvas
[21/9/20, 5:29:26 pm] Jacob: Wow!
[21/9/20, 5:29:41 pm] Ben: But I am here, hi, hope all went alright with the assignment!
[21/9/20, 5:29:53 pm] Jacob: Gday!
[21/9/20, 5:30:24 pm] Ben: Gday gday!
[21/9/20, 5:30:51 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im so behind on everything that isn't the assignment.
Starting last weeks modules now oof
[21/9/20, 5:31:06 pm] Jacob: Far out me two Jordan
[21/9/20, 5:31:14 pm] Jacob: I mean too
[21/9/20, 5:31:27 pm] Ben: I kinda feel you on that! Assignment was full priority and the rest, I'll real in slowly
[21/9/20, 5:31:30 pm] Jacob: I have only done week 1 modules
[21/9/20, 5:31:42 pm] Jacob: I hope to catch up tomorrow
[21/9/20, 5:31:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Need to get ahead i think. Life keeps getting in the way
[21/9/20, 5:32:01 pm] Jacob: Good that programming has been extended
[21/9/20, 5:32:35 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah. I had submitted but there are bits I need to do better
[21/9/20, 5:32:45 pm] Jacob: Oh cool
[21/9/20, 5:33:07 pm] Jacob: I’m finding the justifications a bit tricky
[21/9/20, 5:33:21 pm] Jacob: Like working out what code goes with what
[21/9/20, 5:33:34 pm] Jacob: My program runs perfectly but it’s a bit messy
[21/9/20, 5:37:25 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah
Mines the same.
Im pretty bad at the justifications but I figure if I just make sure it all works it doesn't matter if a lose a few points for bad justification
[21/9/20, 5:43:31 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes , absolutely
[21/9/20, 5:45:39 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Me too, I missed some gterms and my tutor noticed that too
[21/9/20, 5:46:29 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Assignment 2 involves lots of group activities, isn’t it ?
[21/9/20, 5:49:31 pm] Jacob: Yes I think so, I think we have a good team
[21/9/20, 5:50:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah. We got this
[21/9/20, 8:42:50 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Made a teams and invited you all
[21/9/20, 8:43:15 pm] Jacob: Good onya Jordan, thanks
[21/9/20, 8:44:00 pm] Jordon O’Meara: We can use this for general chat and use teams for more official communication
[21/9/20, 8:44:31 pm] Ben: Just gotta get into Teams 😂
The hard start apparently
[21/9/20, 8:44:42 pm] Jacob: 👍
[21/9/20, 8:45:26 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah it looks confusing.
Will have a proper meeting at some point
[21/9/20, 8:46:24 pm] Ben: Sounds good!
[21/9/20, 9:02:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Alright so my plan is to catch up on modules and stuff. And then we can all have a look at assignment and get started towards the end of the week?
[21/9/20, 9:04:23 pm] Ben: I need to catch up on modules too, so I'm cool with that
[21/9/20, 9:04:24 pm] Jacob: Sounds great Jordan I’d appreciate the early week to catch up too
[21/9/20, 9:05:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes am flexible for any time
[21/9/20, 9:06:24 pm] Jacob: Thursday evening, Friday evening or Saturday morning is best for me
[21/9/20, 9:06:58 pm] Jacob: Or Saturday anytime really
[21/9/20, 9:07:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thanks for sharing that Jacob . In Victoria time or Perth time or ?
[21/9/20, 9:07:41 pm] Jacob: I’m in Adelaide so in the middle!

[21/9/20, 9:09:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m in Vic too
[21/9/20, 9:10:08 pm] Jordon O’Meara: But I just wanna make sure I'm all caught up with modules so I don't fall too far behind with them.
[21/9/20, 9:10:48 pm] Murray: Am I the only one from Sydney? I’m usually good on the weekends or week nights after 7
[21/9/20, 9:12:27 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[21/9/20, 9:12:49 pm] Jacob: Do you have time before or after work on Saturday Jordan?
[21/9/20, 9:13:30 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thanks for sharing your location, Muz, Sneha and Ben. Yes - we can’t make much delays for a catch up-
[21/9/20, 9:13:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Saturday morning would work for me. Im working from 1 til 1030 I'm pretty sure.
[21/9/20, 9:14:20 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Great. So let’s fix it on Saturday
[21/9/20, 9:14:40 pm] Jacob: Ok so Saturday morning? You east coast guys should set the time since there’s more of you!

[24/9/20, 6:10:58 pm] Murray: Hey guys. Just realised I can’t make Saturday. I’m in the Hunter Valley looking at wedding venues haha. Completely forgot about it until just now. (Don’t tell my fiancé 😅).
[24/9/20, 6:11:56 pm] Murray: I realise not the best to miss the first one but I’ll be literally flat chat all weekend. Alternatively I can do Sunday night but realise it’s not the best time so understand.
[25/9/20, 8:14:10 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Wow... congratulations in advance 💐💐
[25/9/20, 9:07:44 am] Jordon O’Meara: Sunday night works for me but if not for others we can do it without you and send a recording or notes or something?
[25/9/20, 9:12:10 am] Sneha RMIT: Oh congratulations 🥳 🎂
[25/9/20, 9:12:25 am] Sneha RMIT: Sunday night works for me. No issues

[25/9/20, 1:02:12 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[25/9/20, 1:05:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Looks like we need to do little bit hard work and team work 🙂
[25/9/20, 3:38:59 pm] Jacob: Hi guys yeah Sunday night is cool
[25/9/20, 3:44:06 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im working til 5 i think so what time works best for you guys
[25/9/20, 4:25:29 pm] Ben: I'm working on Sunday until 3, so later should be fine with me too Jordan. 
So are we moving the meet to Sunday evening then?
[25/9/20, 6:21:03 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all. Seems we can able to make our first meeting at 4.00 pm on Sunday .
[25/9/20, 6:21:43 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thanks for letting us know your available 🤝
[25/9/20, 7:08:38 pm] Jacob: Fine for me any time Sunday, but I think Jordan said he will be at work until 5?

[25/9/20, 7:43:22 pm] Murray: Thanks for accomodating the change guys really appreciate it! Can we possibly make it 630/7? Not sure if I’ll be back by 5/530.
[25/9/20, 7:44:06 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im fine with anything im planning to be studying from 5til midnight at this stage
[25/9/20, 7:47:21 pm] Jacob: Ah....i have a dinner booking at 7 so would have to be like 6 at the latest for me...
[26/9/20, 8:05:34 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Do we have a time?
[26/9/20, 10:52:17 pm] Jacob: Not really sure what the plan is...seems like it’s not so easy to organise 6 people!
[26/9/20, 10:52:34 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I think that's the point of it really
[26/9/20, 10:53:47 pm] Jacob: Yeah I guess so...
[26/9/20, 10:54:38 pm] Jacob: Are we available tomorrow around 6? Or do we go to next week?

[26/9/20, 10:55:41 pm] Murray: 630 Melbourne works for me as well 👌
[26/9/20, 10:56:43 pm] Jacob: Noice.
[26/9/20, 10:57:48 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay deal let's go with that. If not everyone then we can record and send to whoever misses? It will be hard to make it work everytime anyway
[26/9/20, 10:58:25 pm] Jacob: Yes that’s true Jordan, we need start rolling I guess!
[26/9/20, 10:58:35 pm] Jacob: I’ll be away next weekend too
[26/9/20, 11:24:52 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 6.30 is okey me
[27/9/20, 4:57:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys really sorry guys but i’m not going to be able to join you guys tonight. My daughter fell down and possibly sprained her arm. Im rushing her to the doctors now
[27/9/20, 4:58:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to have to listen to a recording. If one of you could kindly record

[27/9/20, 5:06:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not sure
[27/9/20, 5:07:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: She fell off the swing
[27/9/20, 5:08:55 pm] Murray: Hope your daughter is okay Sneha :(

[27/9/20, 8:41:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan
[27/9/20, 8:42:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry to hear raj. Seems like a evening full of disasters for a few of us.
[27/9/20, 8:42:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: My daughter has sprained her arm
[27/9/20, 8:42:54 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: How’s your daughter, Sneha... sorry to hear that 🙁
[27/9/20, 8:43:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not too great unfortunately
[27/9/20, 8:44:07 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Prayers for speedy recovery
[27/9/20, 8:44:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[28/9/20, 6:53:43 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jordan and all , I was going through the chat recordings. When will be our next catch up?

[28/9/20, 7:00:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hi guys, Wednesday nights fine with me too
[28/9/20, 7:01:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Only needs to be a 20min meeting or so to touch base.
[28/9/20, 7:01:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe if one of you could assign some work beforehand. Might be a good starting point of discussion
[28/9/20, 7:02:06 pm] Jordon O’Meara: On the teams chat I put some of the stuff we discussed and need to do
[28/9/20, 7:07:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea i saw that. Did you want me to look into anything beforehand.
[28/9/20, 7:10:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Do the team profile and ideal jobs part. And add to docs in teams files
[28/9/20, 7:11:33 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes, she’s recovering ... thx for asking, Jordan
[28/9/20, 7:12:07 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes, we can do that . I’m okey with that

[28/9/20, 7:12:50 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻👍🏻
[28/9/20, 7:24:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sure
[28/9/20, 7:25:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: She’s sprained her arm. So it will take a little while.

[29/9/20, 1:13:26 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah if 7 works for everyone? Or most
[29/9/20, 1:33:27 pm] Jacob: Works for me guys, I’m just having a really terrible time with the internet connection. Hopefully it is sorted by then.
[29/9/20, 1:33:27 pm] Jacob: I’m in the library now using wifi trying to catch up it’s very frustrating
[29/9/20, 2:02:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ohh no fingers crossed that at it all works out for you
[29/9/20, 2:02:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im fine with 7

[30/9/20, 4:22:21 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Not 100% sure ill be at the meeting tonight.
I've had a migraine all day and I feel like I'm gonna pass out. Gonna have a lay down and see if I feel better.
If I'm not, I encourage you guys to do it anyway. The more meetings we have even with less people the better
[30/9/20, 4:23:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: So sorry to hear that jordan. I suffer from migraines so i know how brutal it can be. Get some rest
[30/9/20, 5:03:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just confirming we are still catching up at 7pm Melbourne?

[30/9/20, 5:11:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sure no issues. Im free tomorrow evening. In fact it might be easier as im still at work
[30/9/20, 5:14:46 pm] Jacob: Oh okay then, that might work then. I don’t mind either way, let’s see who is available :)
[30/9/20, 5:15:49 pm] Jacob: Jordan might be feeling better tomorrow too
[30/9/20, 5:16:40 pm] Ben: I'm also available either way :)
[30/9/20, 5:33:37 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry to hear that , Jordan 🙁

[30/9/20, 6:08:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sounds good to me
[30/9/20, 6:08:09 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sure Ben.

[6/10/20, 9:44:44 am] Jacob: No worries....do you want any help with it? Or does anybody else need some help? I’m not really sure how I can contribute at this stage, but I have some time free today
[6/10/20, 9:44:46 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻👍🏻
[6/10/20, 9:45:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi guys I’m confused. How many words required for each topic?
[6/10/20, 10:22:26 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 1200 words or 600 words?
[6/10/20, 10:22:50 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Or any requirements?
[6/10/20, 10:23:09 am] Jacob: hey raj, its 1200 words
[6/10/20, 10:23:26 am] Jacob: 1200 for each topic

[6/10/20, 10:57:33 am] Sneha RMIT: My bad I didn’t realise it was 1200 per topic. Actually makes it easier
[6/10/20, 10:57:51 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll get onto that later today after work.
[6/10/20, 10:57:57 am] Jacob: Hey Sneha, Going well thanks how are you?
[6/10/20, 10:58:36 am] Sneha RMIT: Good jake ☺️ i was struggling with the word count yesterday.  Now it makes sense
[6/10/20, 10:58:51 am] Jacob: Oh haha that’s good!
[6/10/20, 10:59:11 am] Jacob: I don’t have a topic because I think we already have 4
[6/10/20, 10:59:22 am] Jacob: So I don’t really know what to do
[6/10/20, 11:01:18 am] Jacob: Raj, have you started all of your ones? I can take one to make it easier if you want
[6/10/20, 11:26:21 am] Rajaneesh Nair: How sweet of you Jacob. Yes, I’m about to finish three topics, Machine learning, autonomous vehicle, and robots
[6/10/20, 11:26:38 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha is doing Cyber security
[6/10/20, 11:27:15 am] Jacob: wow, well done!
[6/10/20, 11:27:25 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, you can pick one topic of you wish to
[6/10/20, 11:27:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys just a reminder about the Spark plus feedback
[6/10/20, 11:28:12 am] Sneha RMIT: That’s a small part of the assessment
[6/10/20, 11:28:16 am] Jacob: ok sure i can take autonomous vehicles, if you havent gone too far already?
[6/10/20, 11:28:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Even I didn’t know that . Jacob helped me to understand this
[6/10/20, 11:29:12 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I almost finished that 🙁
[6/10/20, 11:29:15 am] Jacob: yes, it's a lot of work for one person to do 3 topics Raj
[6/10/20, 11:33:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, pls go for it. My plan was to start it today even
[6/10/20, 11:33:31 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I was talking about robotics and machine learning
[6/10/20, 11:34:04 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Autonomous vehicle is yours now 🤣
[6/10/20, 11:35:36 am] Ben: I've been working on the cloud solutions, servers one as well as I mentioned. How many did we actually need in this field though, it was only the 4, right?
[6/10/20, 11:35:44 am] Jacob: wait, you have almost finished autonomous vehicles?
[6/10/20, 11:36:03 am] Jacob: yes we need 4 Ben
[6/10/20, 11:36:31 am] Ben: Yeah thought so, have we gone overboard with Raj being a madman/beast?
[6/10/20, 11:36:32 am] Ben: Haha
[6/10/20, 11:36:37 am] Jacob: so Sneha has one, Ben has one, Raj has 3 but has given me one
[6/10/20, 11:36:42 am] Jacob: so Raj you can drop another one!
[6/10/20, 11:36:46 am] Jacob: I reckon!
[6/10/20, 11:36:54 am] Ben: Yeah I thought so!
[6/10/20, 11:37:26 am] Ben: Also excuse my not being active, currently at work so a bit hard to use my phone
[6/10/20, 11:37:29 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Im about finish machine learning and robotics- I didn’t started autonomous yet
[6/10/20, 11:37:45 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Wow... that’s awesome

[6/10/20, 11:43:56 am] Jacob: yes haha i think we should have a meeting
[6/10/20, 11:44:21 am] Jacob: i think the spark feedback is just to give each other feedback after we finish isnt it?
[6/10/20, 11:48:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, I send you my work once I complete. Can you pls help me for spelling and grammar and all

[6/10/20, 9:20:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys just saw the marks for the first assignment. Very happy I got HD’s overall.
[6/10/20, 9:21:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: The comments for the assignments will really help with the next assignment.
[6/10/20, 9:21:25 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Woo congrats. I got HDs for all except two. Which is way better than I was expecting. Lowest was presentation but I was expecting that cause mine was super basic
[6/10/20, 9:21:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great job ⭐️
[6/10/20, 9:21:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: All a learning curve
[6/10/20, 9:22:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: It will help to know what to add
[6/10/20, 9:22:13 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah definitely
[6/10/20, 9:23:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: We’ll get all HD’s in the next one 🏆😉
[6/10/20, 9:23:18 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Definitely
[6/10/20, 9:24:28 pm] Jacob: hey nice work guys, same Jordan I got HD's for all except 2 and the lowest was presentation
[6/10/20, 9:24:36 pm] Jacob: got some really useful feedback
[6/10/20, 9:25:22 pm] Jacob: i got marked down cause i didn't even try to use css
[6/10/20, 9:25:42 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah same haha
[6/10/20, 9:26:21 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Which i knew would happen.
But presentation is only 10% so I focused on the rest first
[6/10/20, 9:26:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great job guys. We’ve got a talented bunch
[6/10/20, 9:27:05 pm] Jacob: yeah i know, me too....the programming assignment was looming then too
[6/10/20, 9:59:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I got 4HD and 2 are bloody lowest 🙂
[6/10/20, 10:24:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s all well raj. You’re doing great
[6/10/20, 10:27:15 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thanks Sneha 🙏🏼 We all did our best
[6/10/20, 11:22:44 pm] Jacob: Hey Raj, I just went through your ML report and fixed up the grammar a bit and changed a few words here and there. Can you please look at it and see if I changed anything important? Especially the third dot point, I may have changed the meaning because I didn't really understand it. You are a good writer!
[7/10/20, 8:26:30 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Awesome... now it’s looks so good . Thank you Jacob 🙂
[7/10/20, 8:55:07 am] Jacob: My pleasure 😊
[7/10/20, 5:43:37 pm] Ben: Somehow I missed marks getting released! 3HD's and 3 D's here, but I HD'd the presentation 😂
[7/10/20, 5:44:31 pm] Ben: Feedback is surprisingly detailed though, which is nice to see! Seems as though the markers actually read through everything which is a positive haha
[7/10/20, 5:57:00 pm] Jacob: hey that's great Ben, good on you. Yeah the feedback was actually pretty useful! Good work on the presentation, I wish I had a bit more time to make mine a bit nicer
[7/10/20, 6:00:33 pm] Jacob: How did everybody go with referencing?
[8/10/20, 11:21:48 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Ben That’s awesome 👏

[10/10/20, 3:47:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Dont stress.
[10/10/20, 3:48:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll sit down tonight to work on the assessment. If i can do anything to help, let me know
[10/10/20, 4:05:04 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Thanks i just feel bad cause everyone else has done so much haha
[11/10/20, 7:32:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Dear Jordan.. you are doing a lot for us  . No need of stress. 🤝🙂
[11/10/20, 6:38:40 pm] Murray: Hey guys I uploaded a draft for the industry data section. Needs some polish but the bones are there. Anyway it’s on teams if you guys wanna have a look and edit. I was trying to find other info other than Burning Glass but was struggling.
[11/10/20, 6:39:18 pm] Murray: I’ll have another go during the week at polishing it up as well.
[11/10/20, 7:20:35 pm] Jacob: Awesome muz! I’m gonna go through the introduction sections tomorrow too and try to link everything together a bit.
[11/10/20, 7:21:46 pm] Jacob: I’ll edit it all together with the industry data but that you wrote
[11/10/20, 8:13:16 pm] Jacob: Hey when can we have a meeting guys? I think we should have one even if not everybody can come
[12/10/20, 12:21:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jacob 👋

[13/10/20, 3:05:07 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Hey good point. I've kind of lost track of the days in the last week.

[13/10/20, 4:49:06 pm] Jacob: Hey guys, everything is pretty well laid out in 'Assignment 2 Draft' file now. The bits that need work are highlighted in yellow. All of our individual work from the teams files are now in the draft file. Please everybody feel free to jump in and edit, add what they want etc. I have tried to write pieces to connect everything and edit in a way that it makes it appear streamlined and not just individual pieces stuck together. I will continue working on this today, and in the following evenings when I can, and I will have a b it of time on the weekend too
[13/10/20, 7:28:11 pm] Murray: Thanks Jake you’re a legend. Had something big come up at work this arvo so I’m still working unfortunately. Will have a look later on tonight if I get time

Tonight and tomorrow I'm gonna be pretty stuck but after that I'm totally free like Thursday and Friday arvo, plus most of the weekend. I'm happy get the Website together for example :)
[13/10/20, 8:20:40 pm] Murray: No worries Ben. I think you had the highest score for presentation if I remember correct haha. Would be awesome if you could have a go at the website.

I had a look at the interview part seem simple to do the actual interview. There is a document with questions which are pretty good.

Sneha did you want to do your boss? I am more than happy to interview my brother. I feel like I haven’t done enough so far haha.
[13/10/20, 8:21:03 pm] Murray: Also I am actually on leave next week so the more I can contribute before Friday the better.
[13/10/20, 8:22:46 pm] Jordon O’Meara: No stress you've done more than me. I am so behind on everything. Work has been insane the last few weeks.
[13/10/20, 9:06:13 pm] Murray: Hey guys I created a new word doco with interview questions. I added a few extra. Have a look when you can and add or remove what you like :).

[13/10/20, 9:16:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Now I realise why I got low marks in presentation 😀
[13/10/20, 9:16:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think one of the requirements this time around is to have the CSS file seperate
[13/10/20, 9:17:28 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: True
[13/10/20, 9:17:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nah raj its all good. We all learn. I had a hard time with the programming story assessment

[13/10/20, 11:21:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great stuff guys 🙂
[14/10/20, 11:41:18 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys
[14/10/20, 11:41:45 am] Sneha RMIT: Can you all upload a photo of yours on teams for the profile section
[14/10/20, 11:44:00 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yep. I just made a folder for photos on there
[14/10/20, 11:44:54 am] Sneha RMIT: Great 😊 thanks jordan
[14/10/20, 11:45:11 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Definitely Sneha. Will do it today itself
[14/10/20, 11:45:28 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks raj
[14/10/20, 11:48:18 am] Jordon O’Meara: I was gonna upload some options for you to choose from. Turns i don't have many nice photos of me
[14/10/20, 12:12:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol im sure that’s not true. Im sure you’re hidding the nice ones somewhere.
[14/10/20, 12:12:29 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I have a habit of squinting in photos
[14/10/20, 12:13:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: You know the funniest thing was at work we were testing the facial recognition app and everyone’s biggest fear was what they would look like 😂
[14/10/20, 12:14:11 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣
[14/10/20, 12:14:24 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Haha
[14/10/20, 12:14:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I have millions of phots worth nothing
[14/10/20, 12:14:39 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🌞
[14/10/20, 12:15:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh and there were so many complaints that people’s faces were not getting recognised by the app after COVID... since they gained a whole lot of weight 🤣
[14/10/20, 12:17:16 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣🤣
[14/10/20, 12:18:57 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Haha yeah. Thats another issue. I've put on a tonne of weight in the last few months. So my more recent photos I don't want to use.
But the majority of the photos I have from when I was doing well weight wise are photos of me at the gym covered in sweat haha.
[14/10/20, 12:19:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂 im in the same boat. Victorians im sure are dieing for gyms to reopen
[14/10/20, 12:19:58 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Very much so
[14/10/20, 12:20:12 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jordan, can you share some of your weight through cloud computing or some other technologies. I’m just 47kg only 🤣
[14/10/20, 12:20:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: We are now “privileged” to go out of the house for exercise for 2 hours
[14/10/20, 12:20:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂😂
[14/10/20, 12:20:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: What’s your secret raj
[14/10/20, 12:21:23 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I don’t know . I’m just like Bonsai tree since childhood. No growth 😂
[14/10/20, 12:21:53 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Haha. Wow I've literally put on 27kgs since march.
After losing 35kg since the previous june(-ish)
[14/10/20, 12:22:33 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m jealous 😌
[14/10/20, 12:22:58 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Just eat really bad and do no exercise it'll happen eventually
[14/10/20, 12:23:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hahah im jealous of you raj. Im exactly the same as jordan. Was doing training every morning. Got super fit and then after covid it’s just been down hill
[14/10/20, 12:23:45 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh man. I eat like a cow now since Covid season . Nothing happening
[14/10/20, 12:24:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: We need to train you raj 😁
[14/10/20, 12:24:18 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣🤣
[14/10/20, 12:24:33 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls 🙏🏼🙏🏼

[14/10/20, 9:25:35 pm] Murray: I just finished the interview. It only went for 15 minutes I was trying to pad it out. You guys reckon that’s ok? There was 13 questions in there.
[14/10/20, 9:25:49 pm] Murray: I’ll write out a transcript and send the recording as well
[14/10/20, 9:27:48 pm] Jacob: Thanks muz! I dunno 15 minutes is a long time, I reckon that’s great
[14/10/20, 9:28:20 pm] Jacob: I can’t see anything on the assignment instructions that say it should be a certain length
[14/10/20, 9:32:42 pm] Murray: Scratch that. The recording file is corrupt have to do it again haha
[14/10/20, 9:33:20 pm] Jacob: Oh no!
[14/10/20, 10:14:47 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Oof bad luck
[15/10/20, 12:53:32 am] Murray: Alrighty I made a new folder on teams for the interview and put the transcript and the recording in there. All done ✅ . Please feel free to review! I apologies for my poor interview skills haha.

[19/10/20, 2:34:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Then tonight i’ll just transfer it to HTML
[19/10/20, 2:35:13 pm] Jacob: yes indeed, perhaps we shoudl have a meeting this evening or tomorrow evening to go over fional submission stuff?
[19/10/20, 2:35:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cool
[19/10/20, 2:35:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll reach home by Melbourne 6.30pm
[19/10/20, 2:37:48 pm] Jacob: cool maybe tomorrow would be better because gayan's lecture and then umera's tutorial is tonight?
[19/10/20, 2:38:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh shoot
[19/10/20, 2:38:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup that’s right
[19/10/20, 2:38:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sounds good with me
[19/10/20, 2:38:37 pm] Jacob: ok awesome let's see who can make it
[19/10/20, 2:39:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great.
[19/10/20, 2:39:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I should be free tomorrow night
[19/10/20, 2:40:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey also if there is any specific images that you guys want added these save it on the images folder i created
[19/10/20, 2:43:46 pm] Jacob: awesome no worries
[19/10/20, 2:44:02 pm] Jacob: ill put in the full screenshots to my ideal job
[19/10/20, 2:44:24 pm] Jacob: or maybe we can just link to our assignment 1 website
[19/10/20, 2:44:43 pm] Jacob: we need to include the links anyway
[19/10/20, 5:20:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Should I put the screenshot from the ideal job in there? I will anyway.
[19/10/20, 5:46:03 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I have the next two days off so anything I can do let me know

[19/10/20, 5:47:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll put it on 😊
[19/10/20, 5:57:40 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Do you guys need any help with the HTML side of things?
[19/10/20, 6:03:23 pm] Ben: Heya all, I really need to get used to actively checking WhatsApp, my bad!
I have just uploaded the document "The Demon Inside" to the Teams files chat.
I'm spent, I've been trying to add to it for ages, writing more in the technologies section has been interesting. I've made it get to  1500 words, and have fleshed out a bit. If anyone would like to jump in and have a look, let me know whatcha think. And where we should add more if you think it is necessary :)
[19/10/20, 6:04:06 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ill have a squizz
[19/10/20, 6:04:13 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Outstanding Efforts, everyone...
[19/10/20, 6:04:52 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤝🤝
[19/10/20, 6:05:13 pm] Ben: Thanks Jordan and Raj! We're actually doing great I think, keep it up all!
[19/10/20, 6:05:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: All are gems ...
[19/10/20, 6:05:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: By tonight i’ll have it done from my end. Then maybe one or two of you can check errors and clean up the finer details
[19/10/20, 6:06:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Truly guys really happy with the amazing team
[19/10/20, 6:06:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: ⭐️
[19/10/20, 6:06:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Awesome let me know and I'll look it over
[19/10/20, 6:06:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[19/10/20, 6:07:58 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Everyone working hard even having tight schedules ...
[19/10/20, 6:08:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m struggling with my IIE’s for intro to programming. On top of it all my canvas is having credential issues
[19/10/20, 6:09:09 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh 🙁
[19/10/20, 6:09:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry to hear that Sneha...
[19/10/20, 6:09:48 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im a week behind on my IIEs.
Still technically haven't got my head around IIE6.
7 was due 9 mins ago and im yet to even look at it. Ha.
I've just come to terms with the fact that I'm submitting late
[19/10/20, 6:11:52 pm] Jacob: This iie was hard, I didn’t finish it properly
[19/10/20, 6:13:56 pm] Jacob: I’m in the lecture now and gayan says we have 5 working days to complete it AFTER the deadline, as long as we submit a bit of progress BEFORE the deadline
[19/10/20, 6:18:37 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Same here.. it is bloody errorful ..🙁
[19/10/20, 6:20:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Constructors on have lost me 😅
[19/10/20, 6:25:21 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I went to bed 5.am today 🤓
[19/10/20, 6:26:10 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I understand them but they just don't work for me.
[19/10/20, 8:15:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys i’m in soup. My canvas access isn’t working and I haven’t even been able to access discussions etc. IT Helpdesk hasn’t done anything.
‎[19/10/20, 8:15:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[19/10/20, 8:15:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: I get this message regarding credentials
[19/10/20, 8:16:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Luckily this doesn’t affect working on HTML
[19/10/20, 8:19:02 pm] Jacob: oh no
[19/10/20, 8:19:20 pm] Jacob: what happens when you click the link?
[19/10/20, 8:20:20 pm] Jacob: can you email anthony and tell him the IT Helpdesk isn't offering support?
[19/10/20, 8:23:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: When i click on anything its blank
[19/10/20, 8:23:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: So i cant see any assessments/ discussions etc
[19/10/20, 8:23:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ive already contacted IT but they still haven’t done anything
[19/10/20, 8:23:41 pm] Jacob: different web browser?
[19/10/20, 8:23:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup
[19/10/20, 8:24:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its a credentials issue. So the faculty has to sort it out 😅
[19/10/20, 8:24:35 pm] Jacob: oh right, what does that mean?
[20/10/20, 1:09:35 am] Sneha RMIT: Guys can we finalise the team name please
‎[20/10/20, 2:35:41 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[20/10/20, 2:36:03 am] Sneha RMIT: Guys made a temporary logo. Just till we decide on something else
[20/10/20, 3:49:07 am] Sneha RMIT: Murray your profile pic is not working because its a TIFF file. Can you convert it to a jpg or png file please
[20/10/20, 6:29:36 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys, ive been up all night

[20/10/20, 6:30:10 am] Sneha RMIT: Just a slight glimpse of what its looking like
[20/10/20, 6:30:20 am] Sneha RMIT: Homepage still needs work
[20/10/20, 6:32:25 am] Jordon O’Meara: Looks great. Is it on github yet? I can work on it while you sleep today if you want
[20/10/20, 6:32:47 am] Sneha RMIT: No not on github yet
[20/10/20, 6:32:57 am] Sneha RMIT: Will need some assistance to put it up
[20/10/20, 6:33:08 am] Sneha RMIT: Ive forgotten how to do that
[20/10/20, 6:45:54 am] Sneha RMIT: Ben could you finish up your reflection when you get a chance today 😊
[20/10/20, 6:46:41 am] Sneha RMIT: Also project idea are there any specific images or videos you want to put in
[20/10/20, 6:46:57 am] Sneha RMIT: So sorry guys bombarding you with messages 😀
[20/10/20, 6:47:27 am] Jordon O’Meara: Jake posted a github repo on teams. If you go to that you should be able to just upload everything to that I think.
[20/10/20, 6:47:44 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok great
[20/10/20, 6:47:50 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan
[20/10/20, 6:48:17 am] Ben: I'll get the reflection done after work, and as for images I'll have a look and see what I can add into the teams file. Only thing I can think of are few images of the inspirations.
[20/10/20, 6:48:51 am] Ben: So an image of Senua, and maybe an Alice in Wonderland.
[20/10/20, 6:49:12 am] Sneha RMIT: All good
[20/10/20, 6:49:25 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to head out for work in an hour
[20/10/20, 6:49:43 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll try my best to get everything uploaded before i go
[20/10/20, 6:50:05 am] Jordon O’Meara: And thanks for sending the messages now so I actually have some motivation to get out of bed instead of going back to sleep ha. Last two nights I've fallen asleep at 8pm when my daughter went to bed and then ended up overstepping. My sleep has been all over the place for weeks for some reason
[20/10/20, 6:50:17 am] Sneha RMIT: Hahah
[20/10/20, 6:50:36 am] Sneha RMIT: I watched Ozark
[20/10/20, 6:50:41 am] Sneha RMIT: That was my inspiration
[20/10/20, 6:50:59 am] Sneha RMIT: I think I finished one season
[20/10/20, 6:52:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok silly question guys
[20/10/20, 6:52:18 am] Sneha RMIT: I have forgotten how to upload the docs on repository
[20/10/20, 6:52:31 am] Sneha RMIT: Can you guys please help
[20/10/20, 6:53:17 am] Jordon O’Meara: Gimme a sec to look. Its been a while
[20/10/20, 6:53:40 am] Sneha RMIT: 😊 thanks
[20/10/20, 6:54:55 am] Sneha RMIT: Im such a idiot
[20/10/20, 6:54:57 am] Jordon O’Meara: Okay so go to the repo and it should have a button with 3 dots at the top right? Click on that and it should say upload files.
[20/10/20, 6:55:08 am] Sneha RMIT: It would have helped if i was signed in
[20/10/20, 6:55:11 am] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂😂
[20/10/20, 6:55:50 am] Sneha RMIT: It says thougg uploads are disabled
‎[20/10/20, 6:56:00 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[20/10/20, 6:56:13 am] Jordon O’Meara: Mmmm maybe Jake has to do something to allow it.
[20/10/20, 6:56:37 am] Jordon O’Meara: How about make a folder on teams and upload it to there and I'll see what I can do
[20/10/20, 6:56:45 am] Sneha RMIT: I reckon he’s got to give access to the other team members to upload things
[20/10/20, 6:57:16 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah maybe. 
Put it all in a folder on teams and I'll see what I can do
[20/10/20, 6:57:29 am] Sneha RMIT: Let me try
[20/10/20, 7:21:04 am] Jordon O’Meara: Let me know how you go
[20/10/20, 7:21:56 am] Sneha RMIT: Ive uploaded whatever i have completed.
[20/10/20, 7:22:21 am] Jordon O’Meara: Awesome ill have a look soon and see if I can get it onto github
[20/10/20, 7:22:39 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[20/10/20, 7:22:47 am] Jordon O’Meara: Go sleep
[20/10/20, 7:23:08 am] Sneha RMIT: Lol got to go to work
[20/10/20, 7:48:32 am] Jordon O’Meara: How do you survive ha
[20/10/20, 7:49:19 am] Sneha RMIT: Switch my brain of thinking about it 😁
[20/10/20, 8:00:02 am] Jacob: Wow
[20/10/20, 8:00:19 am] Jacob: Sneha whats your email address for GitHub?
[20/10/20, 8:02:10 am] Jacob: Or username
[20/10/20, 8:05:15 am] Jacob: I found it I think. I actually found two for you, I sent an invite to both so you should have to accept the invite and then have access to the repo
[20/10/20, 8:05:42 am] Jacob: Can everyone post their usernames and I will send invites
[20/10/20, 8:08:31 am] Sneha RMIT: s3871459@student.rmit.edu.au
[20/10/20, 8:09:08 am] Jacob: Log in to GitHub and see if you have an invite sneha!
[20/10/20, 8:09:50 am] Sneha RMIT: Just on the way to work. Give me an hour or so and i’ll have a look
[20/10/20, 8:09:54 am] Jacob: I think I need usernames, not emails, but I found yours cause you have a photo
[20/10/20, 8:10:21 am] Sneha RMIT: I think mine’s snehasathpathy
[20/10/20, 8:10:37 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool 😊
[20/10/20, 8:10:56 am] Jacob: No probs, I will be at work then so hopefully you will be able to upload and then others will be able to see it
[20/10/20, 8:11:18 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jake
[20/10/20, 8:11:23 am] Jacob: If you can send your username in the next half our or so jordan then you can have access too
[20/10/20, 8:11:56 am] Jacob: I will be back to work hard on the assignment after work tonight
[20/10/20, 8:12:13 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea no stress
[20/10/20, 8:12:20 am] Jacob: Thanks for your effort sneha I can’t believe you stayed up all night and then went to work!
[20/10/20, 8:12:23 am] Sneha RMIT: We’ve got sufficient time
[20/10/20, 8:13:01 am] Sneha RMIT: Na all good. daytime is hard for me and im a night owl anyway 😄
[20/10/20, 8:14:31 am] Jacob: Well good luck today and I hope there is a good coffee machine at work!
[20/10/20, 8:38:22 am] Jordon O’Meara: Mines TheOtherJord
[20/10/20, 8:49:08 am] Jacob: cool, pretty sure i've found everybody except for murray so let me know if you can/can't get it
[20/10/20, 8:49:27 am] Jacob: have a great day everybody
[20/10/20, 9:06:30 am] Jordon O’Meara: Check you're email you signed up to github with. Invite will be there
[20/10/20, 9:21:45 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Looks so beautiful 😍
[20/10/20, 9:27:56 am] Jordon O’Meara: Currently uploading
[20/10/20, 9:31:27 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I got invitation - thank you Jordan and Jacob 🙏🏼
[20/10/20, 9:32:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hope you find difficulties to type my full name 😃
[20/10/20, 9:33:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m sick and tired with my name- it’s bloody long -
[20/10/20, 9:34:18 am] Jordon O’Meara: Id love to change my name. Having an apostrophe in it is frustrating. Especially when it comes to IT stuff.

My sisters work email somehow has an apostrophe in it. It only works on their server and if she has to use it anywhere else it won't accept it
[20/10/20, 9:38:05 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh... I though I am the only person had trouble with name...  my name has three parts- carries my patents name too

1) Rajaneesh (given name)
2)Sankaran Nair( my dad’s name)
3)Sukumarai Amma( mother’s name)
🤪
My brother carries my parents name and grand father’s name too. It’s look like a metro train
[20/10/20, 9:40:15 am] Jordon O’Meara: Haha i like your name. I am a big fan of South Asian names. They always sound so cool
[20/10/20, 9:42:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you so Jordan 😍
[20/10/20, 2:21:03 pm] Murray: Hey guys sorry have been in and out of reception this week. I’ll try and fix up my pic a little later when I get back to the hotel.

Sorry again about the poorly timed week away guys.

Let me know if anything else I need to fix up.
[20/10/20, 2:21:57 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I can try fix the pic for you later if I get a chance
[20/10/20, 2:48:51 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Picture format is fixed.
[20/10/20, 2:49:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks guys
[20/10/20, 2:49:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey jordan can you push to create the website
[20/10/20, 2:50:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: I cant remember exactly how to do it
‎[20/10/20, 2:50:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[20/10/20, 2:51:19 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I think maybe Jake needs to do it cause it's his repo
[20/10/20, 2:51:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ah ok
[20/10/20, 2:51:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: Makes sense
[20/10/20, 2:53:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi sneha, what you think, my photo formate is ok or do i need to upload another on?
[20/10/20, 2:53:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey raj
[20/10/20, 2:54:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yours is perfectly fine 😊👍
[20/10/20, 2:54:50 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Superb. thank you, Sneha...
[20/10/20, 2:56:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Murray's photo is uploaded and good to go.
Added to about page aswell.


Also I've just posted on teams about the Contribution form. If everyone wants to look and decide how we are splitting
[20/10/20, 2:56:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey can some of you edit the pdf. For example- project idea has “i would want” etc
[20/10/20, 2:56:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan
[20/10/20, 2:57:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: Also we need to have look into referencing and cross check that format is consistent throughout and that each section has two references
[20/10/20, 3:00:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: References look pretty solid i think
[20/10/20, 3:02:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Someone just check that the referencing style is consistent
[20/10/20, 3:04:07 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ill double check.

And so pdf-wise ill go through and change all the I's to theys etc
[20/10/20, 3:04:17 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Then should probably combine all the different pages into one
[20/10/20, 3:06:55 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Actually... Do we need to include our individual project ideas from A1 or is it just Ben's new one that we include.
Or will we include them on separate pages to be safe?
[20/10/20, 3:11:59 pm] Ben: As far as I'm aware, just the one I revised, as that was the "decided upon" project idea we are going with.
[20/10/20, 3:12:59 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay cool so no point editing the rest
[20/10/20, 3:13:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup that’s
[20/10/20, 3:13:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Right
[20/10/20, 3:13:52 pm] Ben: Nope, I have left the project under its own file atm, as I wasn't sure if it would be great just throwing it into the draft page with everything else haha
[20/10/20, 3:14:05 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im just transferring the info for project idea
[20/10/20, 3:14:08 pm] Ben: Did anyone have a chance to go through it btw?
[20/10/20, 3:14:11 pm] Ben: Okie
[20/10/20, 3:14:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: If there could be some pics or videos would be great for us to add on
[20/10/20, 3:14:47 pm] Ben: I'll have a look for some relevant picture ideas
[20/10/20, 3:15:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks ben 😊
[20/10/20, 3:16:56 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I had a read. Great job
[20/10/20, 3:17:47 pm] Ben: Awesome, anything to add curiously? It is a bit over 1500 words, but I wasn't sure if we wanted more depth anywhere atm
[20/10/20, 3:19:02 pm] Jordon O’Meara: What are we going with for team name?
[20/10/20, 3:19:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nah i think that should be fine. You did well
[20/10/20, 3:20:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just some pics or maybe a graphical diagram to show the flow would ace it
[20/10/20, 3:21:11 pm] Ben: No clue Jordan ahahaha

And for now I was just thinking of some pics of inspirations. Graphical diagrams can be for Assessment 3 I feel
[20/10/20, 3:21:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Whatever you feel comfortable with 😊
[20/10/20, 3:22:40 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im gonna go through and combine all of the different docs we have into one to be the main pdf if that's cool?
[20/10/20, 3:22:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Perfect
[20/10/20, 3:23:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: That would just avoid updating any changes
[20/10/20, 3:23:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks so much for doing that jordan
[20/10/20, 3:23:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Really appreciate it
[20/10/20, 3:24:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Also there is ben’s reflection we need to update
[20/10/20, 3:24:32 pm] Ben: My bad, I added it late haha
[20/10/20, 3:24:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol all good
[20/10/20, 3:25:47 pm] Ben: Where should I put the images Sneha? Just in the images tab on Teams?
[20/10/20, 3:26:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: If you could put it in the images folder thanks ben
[20/10/20, 3:27:26 pm] Ben: Easy, the image of Senua has a reference already, which I may need to add to our thing, and the Joker one I'll create one
[20/10/20, 3:28:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[20/10/20, 3:28:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Also can you get two references for the project idea section
[20/10/20, 3:28:53 pm] Ben: Yeah I'm grabbing my original ones real quick
[20/10/20, 3:29:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: ⭐️
[20/10/20, 3:29:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Legend
[20/10/20, 3:30:41 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Also reminder for everyone if you haven't already.
Sparkplus needs to be done
[20/10/20, 3:30:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yes that’s me
[20/10/20, 3:31:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan
[20/10/20, 3:31:06 pm] Ben: Same hahaha
[20/10/20, 3:31:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Far out so much to do 😅
[20/10/20, 3:32:31 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry guys, I got a job after 7 months in a bubble wrap making company.and I’m doing the orientation program 😩 sleepy and boring
[20/10/20, 3:32:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Just a lot of little things. You guys have the bulk of it done
[20/10/20, 3:33:06 pm] Jordon O’Meara: We have til tomorrow night yeah?
[20/10/20, 3:34:41 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you for your efforts.. I’m bit scared to touch GitHub work , I don’t want to make a mess😂
[20/10/20, 3:36:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Especially on this final moments..
[20/10/20, 3:43:37 pm] Ben: Sorry Sneha, I ended u padding references as you were copying them I think hahaha
[20/10/20, 3:44:01 pm] Ben: But I just added those 3 to match what I added as examples in the project idea
[20/10/20, 3:44:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: No issues at all. Thank you so much
[20/10/20, 3:44:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ive added the references
[20/10/20, 3:44:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: The images
[20/10/20, 3:44:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is there a order
[20/10/20, 3:44:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: And where specifically do they need to be inserted
[20/10/20, 3:44:43 pm] Ben: No particular order on the images, but alphabetical for referencing is all I know haha
[20/10/20, 3:45:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: This section is nearly done
[20/10/20, 3:45:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Now just adding the images
[20/10/20, 3:45:44 pm] Ben: They are all referencing the inspirations, so at least the Joker image and Fight Club should be near there.
The Senua one can be later on to split it up, as it fits under the game mechanics more due to being directly from one itself
[20/10/20, 3:45:51 pm] Ben: Amazing
[20/10/20, 4:03:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: @61424441545 do you have the image files of the screen shots of your ideal job. For some reason they aren't showing up in the doc
[20/10/20, 4:07:50 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes . I’ll add it again in the folder
[20/10/20, 4:08:38 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: It’s in my google drive - give me 10 minutes. I’ll upload
[20/10/20, 4:08:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🙏🏼
[20/10/20, 4:10:52 pm] Ben: Sparkplus done here... What an odd system for feedback
[20/10/20, 4:12:45 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jordan, uploaded three images now in Teams
[20/10/20, 4:13:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: It is ...
[20/10/20, 4:22:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Project ideas is now done. Ready to be uploaded onto github
[20/10/20, 4:22:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve uploaded it onto teams
[20/10/20, 4:29:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok group reflections is also now ready with the updates added. I’ve uploaded the lastest copy on teams
[20/10/20, 4:30:16 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah spark plus is odd
[20/10/20, 4:30:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Thanks raj
[20/10/20, 4:30:41 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Great work sneha
[20/10/20, 4:31:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok im going to go zone out for a bit. Be back a bit later and finish the rest
[20/10/20, 4:31:48 pm] Ben: Thanks for all your hard work Sneha!
[20/10/20, 4:31:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Go have a well deserved rest
[20/10/20, 4:32:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks guys. You all are real champs 🍺
[20/10/20, 5:14:10 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Sneha. Once you've rested ive just noticed we need your paragraph for the industry data section
[20/10/20, 5:26:07 pm] Jacob: hey guys, im back, just catching up on the chat
[20/10/20, 5:28:44 pm] Jacob: I like your name too Raj, it's unique so it was no trouble to find you! my partner is Chilean and they have similar format to you I think when they carry both parents' names
[20/10/20, 5:31:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: When you get the chance Jake can you set up github pages for the repo?
[20/10/20, 5:32:36 pm] Jacob: yep ill do that now
[20/10/20, 5:32:43 pm] Jacob: did everyone get access okay?
[20/10/20, 5:33:59 pm] Jacob: Ben, did you get an invite or did I get the wrong BenSaar?
[20/10/20, 5:39:17 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jacob for the invitation.. 🤝🙂
[20/10/20, 5:53:50 pm] Ben: I may not have checked my GitHub haha, give me a minute
[20/10/20, 5:55:41 pm] Ben: Wait, it was an invite in GitHub, right?
[20/10/20, 5:56:11 pm] Jacob: yeah, but not sure if you got an email notification or not
[20/10/20, 5:56:36 pm] Ben: Wrong account id say, BenSaaar is me. Somebody somehow already had BenSaar
[20/10/20, 6:04:48 pm] Jacob: gotcha
[20/10/20, 6:05:05 pm] Jacob: im having trouble setting up pages, keep getting 404
[20/10/20, 6:05:26 pm] Ben: Good ol' GitHub
[20/10/20, 6:32:34 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah just wait it will work eventually
[20/10/20, 6:34:22 pm] Ben: 😆
[20/10/20, 6:52:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry guys got a bit of a headache. Im going to lie down for a few hours. Finish the remaining tonight.
[20/10/20, 6:52:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: What do i need to put in the IT Work - interview section
[20/10/20, 6:52:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Do we have a pic of the person interview maybe
[20/10/20, 6:53:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Or can we put a audio recording of the interview
[20/10/20, 7:33:03 pm] Jordon O’Meara: If say put the whole transcript and a link to record at the top
[20/10/20, 7:41:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: On html?
‎[20/10/20, 7:47:39 pm] Jacob: ‎image omitted
[20/10/20, 7:48:23 pm] Jacob: It’s doing my head in
[20/10/20, 7:52:27 pm] Jordon O’Meara: yeah think it's good. Just leave it for a bit  my a1 took a bit
[20/10/20, 7:52:44 pm] Jacob: ok cool
[20/10/20, 7:54:18 pm] Jacob: where are we at, is there somthing i can work on?
[20/10/20, 7:55:52 pm] Jacob: has anybody started working on the other pdf we need to submit?
[20/10/20, 7:56:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve got 3 sections left to complete:

Ideal Jobs
Industry Data
IT Work

I had put a seperate section for references. But i think that wont be necessary given that we have sufficient
[20/10/20, 7:56:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe that page can be put for something else
[20/10/20, 7:57:09 pm] Jacob: as in we need to convert those to HTML still?
[20/10/20, 7:57:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yes . Input the data
[20/10/20, 7:57:41 pm] Jacob: cool ill start on ideal jobs
[20/10/20, 7:57:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ideal jobs is the big one
[20/10/20, 7:58:04 pm] Jacob: no worries
[20/10/20, 7:58:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: What will you do with the ideal jobs?
[20/10/20, 7:59:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: The page hasn’t been uploaded yet
[20/10/20, 7:59:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe you can do the pdf if jordan isn’t doing it as he was saying earlier that he was looking into it
[20/10/20, 8:00:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you work on the homepage section please jake
[20/10/20, 8:00:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Content is in there but needs some revising
[20/10/20, 8:02:28 pm] Jacob: yes sure, i'll work on homepage
[20/10/20, 8:02:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[20/10/20, 8:02:59 pm] Jacob: just trying to orientate myself with atom
[20/10/20, 8:03:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: No worries
[20/10/20, 8:05:32 pm] Jacob: so we have about.html, index.html, team career psychoilogical...html
[20/10/20, 8:05:41 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Pdf is started.
[20/10/20, 8:05:47 pm] Jacob: is index the main one and then the others will be linked to from there?
[20/10/20, 8:06:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ill finish pdf soon. Just getting the little one to bed
[20/10/20, 8:07:23 pm] Jacob: 👍
[20/10/20, 8:07:35 pm] Jacob: let me know if you want help with it
[20/10/20, 8:09:01 pm] Murray: Thanks Jordon for doing the picture, you’re a legend. If we need a photo of my brother I’ll ask if he’s cool with it 👌👌.
[20/10/20, 8:11:02 pm] Jacob: so we're running with pseudo boomers? any objections?
[20/10/20, 8:13:10 pm] Jacob: Sneha, home page is great, i just added an " and took out your phone number? is there something more you wanted to do?
[20/10/20, 8:13:36 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im fine with anything
[20/10/20, 8:14:16 pm] Jacob: yeah i think we probably all will say that, and it's already in there from Sneha, top work
[20/10/20, 8:24:43 pm] Jacob: i'm going through reflections now and just checking and editing for consistency.
[20/10/20, 8:24:58 pm] Jacob: is this what i should be doing Sneha?
[20/10/20, 8:25:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks a million
[20/10/20, 8:25:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea just go through everything
[20/10/20, 8:25:28 pm] Jacob: yep no worries
[20/10/20, 8:25:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Check that it all make sense
[20/10/20, 8:25:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Typos, spelling errors
[20/10/20, 8:25:59 pm] Jacob: cool 👍
[20/10/20, 8:26:44 pm] Jacob: Are you ising atom?
[20/10/20, 8:26:47 pm] Jacob: using
[20/10/20, 8:26:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: In the meantime i’m going to put a draft section page for Ideal Jobs. Can you help me transferring the stuff on that
[20/10/20, 8:27:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: It would be a big help
[20/10/20, 8:27:09 pm] Jacob: yes sure
[20/10/20, 8:27:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: What’s atom
[20/10/20, 8:27:52 pm] Jacob: it's like a notepad editor that anthony showed us
[20/10/20, 8:28:23 pm] Jacob: it has a live preview feature that has been useful
[20/10/20, 8:29:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not sure sorry
[20/10/20, 8:29:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Dont think so
[20/10/20, 8:29:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh i used notepad++
[20/10/20, 8:30:49 pm] Jacob: yeah nah don't worry, you're doing marvellously with notepad ++ then
[20/10/20, 8:31:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[20/10/20, 9:16:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jake im just going to put the ideal jobs page on teams
[20/10/20, 9:16:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Could you please work on that
[20/10/20, 9:16:20 pm] Jacob: yep leave it with me
[20/10/20, 9:16:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve constructed the elements
[20/10/20, 9:16:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: That will help you
[20/10/20, 9:16:37 pm] Jacob: awesome thanks
[20/10/20, 9:18:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: All of the ideal job images are under images
[20/10/20, 9:24:19 pm] Jacob: 👍
[20/10/20, 9:26:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im also putting the table image for ideal jobs in the HTML folder
[20/10/20, 9:31:14 pm] Jacob: got the table
[20/10/20, 9:31:17 pm] Jacob: thanks
[20/10/20, 9:31:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😊
[20/10/20, 9:31:48 pm] Jacob: so images contains ideal job screenshots for raj, jake and jordan
[20/10/20, 9:32:10 pm] Jacob: are the others somewhere else?
[20/10/20, 9:32:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not sure
[20/10/20, 9:32:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: But its in the other draft doc
[20/10/20, 9:32:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: You could just save that
[20/10/20, 9:32:52 pm] Jacob: that's cool, i'll start with what we have here
[20/10/20, 9:33:00 pm] Jacob: oh yep of course
[20/10/20, 9:54:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jake can you also push through so we get the URL link. Only you have access i think
[20/10/20, 9:54:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: That will give a indication of what its looking like
[20/10/20, 9:57:02 pm] Jacob: hang on, im just having a github fight
[20/10/20, 9:57:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: Haha
[20/10/20, 9:57:25 pm] Jacob: trying to pull from my editor
‎[20/10/20, 9:57:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[20/10/20, 9:57:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Try these steps
[20/10/20, 9:57:58 pm] Jacob: yeah i did that earlier and it still says error 404 when you click it. Jordan says we just need to wait
[20/10/20, 9:58:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: The docs are already uploaded by jordan
[20/10/20, 9:58:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s awkward
[20/10/20, 9:58:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Wonder why that’s happening
[20/10/20, 9:58:39 pm] Jacob: https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository/
[20/10/20, 9:58:45 pm] Jacob: thats the link anyway
[20/10/20, 9:58:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya got that
[20/10/20, 9:59:58 pm] Jacob: i just pushed the ideal job files from my browser and now im trying to work out how to pull them to my editor
[20/10/20, 10:00:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hmm 🤔 good question
[20/10/20, 10:00:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not unfortunately the expert here
[20/10/20, 10:06:20 pm] Jacob: getting there i think
[20/10/20, 10:09:40 pm] Jacob: ok i think i lost a bunch of work. not ideal
[20/10/20, 10:10:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: All Good
[20/10/20, 10:10:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Everything is backed up
[20/10/20, 10:10:43 pm] Jacob: yeah except for what i just did and didnt push
[20/10/20, 10:10:52 pm] Jacob: im trying to find it on my computer
[20/10/20, 10:10:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ouch
[20/10/20, 10:25:01 pm] Jacob: got it, phew!
[20/10/20, 10:25:10 pm] Jacob: back on track
[20/10/20, 11:06:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: ⭐️
[21/10/20, 12:36:16 am] Jacob: ok ideal jobs section is done
[21/10/20, 12:36:36 am] Sneha RMIT: Great 👍
[21/10/20, 12:36:50 am] Sneha RMIT: Industry data done too
[21/10/20, 12:37:02 am] Jacob: nice work
[21/10/20, 12:37:02 am] Sneha RMIT: Just got IT work left
[21/10/20, 12:37:31 am] Sneha RMIT: Its 12.40am here and my heads spinning
[21/10/20, 12:37:42 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to bed now
[21/10/20, 12:37:48 am] Sneha RMIT: Nite guys
[21/10/20, 12:38:26 am] Jacob: night Sneha, thanks for your efforts
[21/10/20, 12:38:39 am] Sneha RMIT: Same to you 😊
[21/10/20, 12:38:57 am] Sneha RMIT: Im a still a bit confused about the IT work one
[21/10/20, 12:39:25 am] Jacob: ill have a look, maybe i can use one of the other pages as a template
[21/10/20, 12:39:58 am] Sneha RMIT: Ive got the template saved already
[21/10/20, 12:40:13 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll just put it on teams if you want
[21/10/20, 12:40:37 am] Jacob: yeah do that, then it will be good to get it done now
[21/10/20, 12:40:40 am] Sneha RMIT: I think we insert the recording and transcript
[21/10/20, 12:40:47 am] Jacob: so we can just finalise tomorrow night
[21/10/20, 12:41:04 am] Jacob: yeah not sure how to do the recording but ill have a go
[21/10/20, 12:46:11 am] Sneha RMIT: Yup I’ve uploaded it now in the html folder
[21/10/20, 12:47:13 am] Jacob: thanks yep, got it!
[21/10/20, 12:47:31 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[21/10/20, 12:47:58 am] Jacob: no worries, have a good sleep!
[21/10/20, 12:54:48 am] Jordon O’Meara: I will have the pdf done by tomorrow afternoon.
I fell asleep early and umhave woken up with a migraine so there's a good chance ill be having a sleep in
[21/10/20, 12:56:36 am] Jacob: no dramas Jordan rest well, hope you feel better tomorrow. I will be at work tomorrow too, i'm just doing what i can now before i crash out and then hopefully we can finish the rest in the evening
[21/10/20, 2:29:10 am] Jacob: IT Work is done, it's very basic and could probably use a bit of prettying  and a check/edit but the transcipt is there and the audio is working.
[21/10/20, 8:03:45 am] Jacob: Also I think we need to do 400 words of group reflection in addition to our individual work. I will do it today after work unless someone gets a chance today
[21/10/20, 8:23:20 am] Jacob: Also, pages is still showing error. Not sure why I just change ‘Index.html’ to ‘index.html’ so let’s see if that does anything if anyone has any ideas please let me know
[21/10/20, 8:23:54 am] Jacob: I’ll be back around 5-6 tonight
[21/10/20, 8:34:49 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah that will help. I think its more case sensitive on github I think
[21/10/20, 8:34:57 am] Jordon O’Meara: Ill have a look when I get on
[21/10/20, 8:35:56 am] Jacob: here's the link again in case anybody wants to check it during the day https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository/
[21/10/20, 8:39:31 am] Jacob: repo link if tht helps https://github.com/Jake-Patrick/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository.git
[21/10/20, 9:22:48 am] Sneha RMIT: Has the css file been uploaded
[21/10/20, 9:23:06 am] Sneha RMIT: Without the css file it wont work
[21/10/20, 9:52:04 am] Jordon O’Meara: Could be another case sensitive thing
[21/10/20, 10:25:51 am] Jordon O’Meara: Ill check over all the file names and stuff in a minute.
I remember with a1 I had a bunch of stuff that would work fine on my computer but wouldn't work at all on github and it was entirely the fact that some things were capitalised
[21/10/20, 10:50:20 am] Sneha RMIT: Should i try from my account
[21/10/20, 10:51:28 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m working from home today 😁 so i can look at things
‎[21/10/20, 11:13:27 am] Jordon O’Meara: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 11:20:43 am] Sneha RMIT: Font needs to be changed
[21/10/20, 11:20:49 am] Sneha RMIT: And i thinking spacing
[21/10/20, 11:21:13 am] Sneha RMIT: It looks different when its up on the website that’s why i wanted to see it
[21/10/20, 11:21:20 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan 😊
[21/10/20, 11:23:19 am] Jordon O’Meara: I've also fixed some stuff on the about page. Resized images slightly si they aren't as squished.

For some reason rajs picture wouldn't work but i fixed that.
[21/10/20, 11:23:59 am] Sneha RMIT: Great job
[21/10/20, 11:25:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Wow.. looks stunning, Sneha and Jordan 🤝🤝
[21/10/20, 11:47:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Jordan couple of things need to be changed. There is the references tab in the code. That needs to be removed as we no longer need a seperate section for references
[21/10/20, 11:48:08 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll go in and change that
[21/10/20, 11:49:00 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yep. Cool im currently changing the in-text links to hyperlinks
[21/10/20, 11:50:23 am] Sneha RMIT: We need to check that there are 9 pages: index, team profile, behavioural test results, Ideal jobs, industry data, IT work, IT technologies, Project Ideas, Group Reflection
[21/10/20, 11:50:42 am] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 12:06:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Can somebody test the links on the behavioural test page.

I've got two of them that won't load the page yet if you go to the exact website they lead to they just don't work
[21/10/20, 12:08:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Where do i do that
[21/10/20, 12:09:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey jordan i just noticed you changed the name Index.html to index.html. Make sure you change that on all the other pages otherwise it wont connect
[21/10/20, 12:09:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you push it and make it as a website so that i can see whether its flowing smoothly
[21/10/20, 12:11:00 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah it should be all good.
[21/10/20, 12:11:19 pm] Jordon O’Meara: The index name was the issue earlier. Case sensitive stuff.
[21/10/20, 12:11:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[21/10/20, 12:12:24 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Project idea page should be up and running in a sec
‎[21/10/20, 12:12:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 12:13:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: This section on all the pages need the Index.html changed
[21/10/20, 12:14:17 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep doing that now
[21/10/20, 12:16:43 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Should all be done.
[21/10/20, 12:17:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[21/10/20, 12:17:35 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Might just have to wait for it a bit cause seems to be linking to Index at this stage
[21/10/20, 12:18:42 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Also on the ideal jobs page the white background bit doesn't seem to work.. any idea how to fix that?
‎[21/10/20, 12:18:56 pm] Jordon O’Meara: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 12:19:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: It seems like the code has been changed
[21/10/20, 12:21:02 pm] Jordon O’Meara: All I did was resize the images slightly. But I think it was like that before I did it
[21/10/20, 12:21:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: No all good
‎[21/10/20, 12:21:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 12:21:45 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Woo
[21/10/20, 12:21:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: It should be looking like this
[21/10/20, 12:22:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: What should be do
[21/10/20, 12:22:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: It seems somewhere one slight code might be out
[21/10/20, 12:22:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: As the same thing has happened on the home page
[21/10/20, 12:23:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll just send some screenshots to give an idea of what it should all have looked like
‎[21/10/20, 12:23:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 12:23:34 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Home page looks fine to me...

‎[21/10/20, 12:24:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 12:24:38 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Is only the jobs page. Ill have a look and see what is different
[21/10/20, 12:25:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: IT work I hadn’t touched on but the format was set
‎[21/10/20, 12:25:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted

[21/10/20, 12:26:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: References - needs to be deleted
[21/10/20, 12:31:03 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep. Thats on my list
[21/10/20, 12:31:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im here if you need
[21/10/20, 12:31:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just need to make some changes on the cyber security section
[21/10/20, 12:35:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I don't understand why that white bit isn't working for ideal jobs.
Its identical code wise to the version on teams and thats working fine..
[21/10/20, 12:35:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Let me have a look
[21/10/20, 12:37:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Where is the file located
[21/10/20, 12:38:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Github. Ideal Jobs.html
[21/10/20, 12:38:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok thanks
[21/10/20, 12:40:09 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Also is there an image file for "run after job.jpg" for industry data page?
[21/10/20, 12:40:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup
[21/10/20, 12:40:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Need that uploaded to github
[21/10/20, 12:41:20 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Found it dw
‎[21/10/20, 12:41:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎video omitted
[21/10/20, 12:41:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should be at the bottom
[21/10/20, 12:43:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Could this be the issue for ideal jobs: two images
‎[21/10/20, 12:43:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 12:43:46 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep got it going..

Not sure... shouldn't be
[21/10/20, 12:44:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its hard for me as i cant see properly what happens when i make a change
[21/10/20, 12:44:57 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah you've gotta wait a few minutes for it to work.

Do we have a page for IT technologies anywhere?
[21/10/20, 12:45:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup I do
[21/10/20, 12:45:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: But i just have to make some changes on the contend of cyber security
[21/10/20, 12:45:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should i add it first and then send it
[21/10/20, 12:45:58 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay cool that's the only one left to get onto github
[21/10/20, 12:46:04 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah finish it up first
[21/10/20, 12:46:53 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ill try figure it the ideal jobs thing
[21/10/20, 12:47:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im on the same page
[21/10/20, 12:48:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: I have a feeling the section dividers have been changed
[21/10/20, 12:48:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s why its doing that
[21/10/20, 12:48:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to copy the code on my notes and have a look
[21/10/20, 12:49:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Then upload a revised version
[21/10/20, 12:51:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup the coding has gone off
[21/10/20, 12:51:29 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Thats a good idea
[21/10/20, 12:51:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: And the text formatting has changed
[21/10/20, 12:51:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Leave it to me
[21/10/20, 12:51:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll fix it
[21/10/20, 12:52:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll leave spaces where the images have to be inserted so that we aren’t double dipping
[21/10/20, 12:57:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: The references link has been removed from all current pages
[21/10/20, 12:57:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 12:57:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[21/10/20, 1:14:21 pm] Jordon O’Meara: And pdf is basically ready to go.
Just need to copy and paste a few changes from the final site once its all done.
[21/10/20, 1:14:56 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Gonna take a break and then I'll work on the "tools" stuff.

Links to meetings etc.
[21/10/20, 1:15:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: I still have to upload the IT technologies
[21/10/20, 1:15:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: And im working on the Ideal job
[21/10/20, 1:15:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan
[21/10/20, 1:15:58 pm] Jordon O’Meara: All good.
[21/10/20, 1:31:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok so this has got to do with the name change from Index.html to index.html
[21/10/20, 1:31:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: It’s not being able to comprehend the connect
[21/10/20, 1:32:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: Because the css file  recognises Index rather than index
[21/10/20, 1:33:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ahhhh. Weird... thats odd
[21/10/20, 1:33:29 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Cause yeah it needs to be index or the main page won't work
[21/10/20, 1:33:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: So basically i’ll change it from my end here
[21/10/20, 1:34:02 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ok cool hopefully it works
[21/10/20, 1:34:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll upload the index again
[21/10/20, 1:34:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Funny thing is
[21/10/20, 1:34:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: It shouldn’t have needed to be changed
[21/10/20, 1:34:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: As it was already in lower case
[21/10/20, 1:35:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Code is weird like that sometimes. Reminds me of some of the issues im having in programming
[21/10/20, 1:35:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: I just went to change the file name and its all in lower case
[21/10/20, 1:35:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😅
[21/10/20, 1:37:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry by bad it was a different file
[21/10/20, 1:37:12 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Weird.. worst case scenario. We leave it and potentially lose one point?
[21/10/20, 1:37:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll upload it again
[21/10/20, 1:53:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok ive uploaded the revised index file
[21/10/20, 2:02:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jordan i cant figure out why ideal jobs - formatting keeps breaking. I think it may be to do with the images
[21/10/20, 2:03:00 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Very strange. Leave it for now.
Might just try re do the whole page
[21/10/20, 2:03:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ redoing the page
[21/10/20, 2:03:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: I will leave the part with the images
[21/10/20, 2:03:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay cool
[21/10/20, 2:05:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: I have a slight suspicion it’s because the images added later are pretty big
[21/10/20, 2:06:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: So it cant handle the dimensions
[21/10/20, 2:21:41 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ahhh.
I might resize the images separately and upload new versions then
[21/10/20, 2:22:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Do a version without the images and I'll re do them and see if it works
[21/10/20, 2:28:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry left my phone in the other room
[21/10/20, 2:28:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: I was going to say the same thing
[21/10/20, 2:28:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: So basically css file has the formatting at 800px
[21/10/20, 2:28:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: And the images were quite big
[21/10/20, 2:29:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Which is my i think it was breaking the format
[21/10/20, 2:29:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll upload the file of ideal jobs up til there wasn’t any issues
[21/10/20, 2:29:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jordan please can you have a look
[21/10/20, 2:33:40 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ill look into it
[21/10/20, 2:34:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think i got it
[21/10/20, 2:34:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Each image had a border
[21/10/20, 2:35:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Oh?
[21/10/20, 2:35:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup so when for example jake put in two pics that would have broken the formatt
[21/10/20, 2:36:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Give me a bit longer. I’ll try from my side to put in most of the data and you can put in the images
[21/10/20, 2:40:29 pm] Jordon O’Meara: All good.
[21/10/20, 2:40:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jordan the border was definitely the issue 😊
[21/10/20, 2:55:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Oh cool. I was about to say.
We have 9hrs to go to get this done. So if we can't fix it then let's concentrate on getting the rest done
[21/10/20, 2:56:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😅
[21/10/20, 2:56:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nearly done. Its all fine
[21/10/20, 2:56:57 pm] Jordon O’Meara: 👍
[21/10/20, 2:56:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just insert the images where its missing but other than that its looking good
[21/10/20, 3:00:18 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay cool.
[21/10/20, 3:01:38 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Let me know when it's on github and I'll have a look
[21/10/20, 3:02:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll put it on teams in a min
[21/10/20, 3:02:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you please put it on github
[21/10/20, 3:07:34 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep will do
[21/10/20, 3:08:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: Done
[21/10/20, 3:08:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just uploaded
[21/10/20, 3:08:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ive inserted some text where the images need to go
‎[21/10/20, 3:09:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 3:09:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Cool ill see how it goes
‎[21/10/20, 3:09:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 3:09:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: There is also a youtube video
[21/10/20, 3:10:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep. Uploaded to github. Waiting for it to work now
[21/10/20, 3:10:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: Going to have a 10min break and then finalise the IT technologies
[21/10/20, 3:12:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey is IT work all working fine?
[21/10/20, 3:14:02 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah have a good break
[21/10/20, 3:14:07 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep it's up and running
[21/10/20, 3:27:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yay
[21/10/20, 3:29:46 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: You guys are working hard for website. Jordan and Sneha, anything you guys want me to do?
[21/10/20, 3:30:16 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: You guys are having sleepless days and nights
[21/10/20, 3:30:48 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Uuuum. Not really sure what there is for you to do at this point...
[21/10/20, 3:31:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks raj
[21/10/20, 3:31:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: Pretty much there
[21/10/20, 3:31:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just got some contend changes on IT technologies and then its done
[21/10/20, 3:31:38 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I would like to make you masala chai for you guys
[21/10/20, 3:31:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lollll
[21/10/20, 3:32:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[21/10/20, 3:32:32 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🙂🙏🏼
[21/10/20, 3:35:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: And I gotta get these images to work on the ideal jobs page 🤞
[21/10/20, 3:35:35 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Doing them one by one so if any of them cause issues I know which one
[21/10/20, 3:36:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great job jordan
[21/10/20, 3:36:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: ⭐️
[21/10/20, 3:36:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: This will all turn out great
[21/10/20, 3:54:32 pm] Jordon O’Meara: What you can do raj is have a look through the website and see if everything works.
‎[21/10/20, 4:39:30 pm] Jordon O’Meara: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 4:40:40 pm] Jordon O’Meara: If so. I've uploaded to the teams page. If we can download it  and sign one by one. Thatd be great
[21/10/20, 4:40:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 4:41:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: Uploading the IT technologies page in 10mins
[21/10/20, 4:41:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Two paragraphs changed in contend
[21/10/20, 4:41:40 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Awesome. Once that's done I'll finish the pdf.
[21/10/20, 4:41:52 pm] Ben: I'm happy, why give yourself the decrease in contribution tho? 🙃
[21/10/20, 4:41:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks champ
[21/10/20, 4:42:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: I was going to say the same
[21/10/20, 4:42:32 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I did very little for the last few weeks and you guys smashed up out. I wouldn't feel comfortable having the same percentage as you guys
[21/10/20, 4:43:01 pm] Jordon O’Meara: It looks like a big drop but split amongst 5 others its not much
[21/10/20, 4:43:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol 😂 put that in the notes.
[21/10/20, 4:45:11 pm] Ben: As long as you're happy, I'll download it and sign now
[21/10/20, 4:45:58 pm] Jordon O’Meara: 👍
[21/10/20, 4:46:44 pm] Jordon O’Meara: And we did check that only 1 member needs to submit yeah?
[21/10/20, 4:48:37 pm] Ben: I believe it was confirmed
[21/10/20, 4:49:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay cool. Since I'm doing the pdfs ill submit it then?
[21/10/20, 4:49:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup sounds good to me
[21/10/20, 4:49:45 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Awesome
[21/10/20, 4:51:29 pm] Ben: I go to use the sign feature within Adobe and the entire document breaks on me lol
[21/10/20, 4:51:47 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Strange I just opened in my browser and it worked
[21/10/20, 4:51:49 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Try that
[21/10/20, 4:52:52 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Other option is people can send me a picture of their signature and I can try copy it? If that's not too dodgy for you
[21/10/20, 4:53:57 pm] Ben: That worked fine in the browser. I was trying to use Adobe readers actual signifier function
[21/10/20, 4:54:01 pm] Ben: It didn't like that haha
[21/10/20, 4:54:48 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Cool. As long as everyone gets it done before later tonight
[21/10/20, 4:54:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jordan can you please just sign SS on my behalf
[21/10/20, 4:55:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: I dont mind

[21/10/20, 5:17:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll have to come back in 40mins and upload it
[21/10/20, 5:19:26 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Oops all good. Plenty of time
[21/10/20, 5:22:35 pm] Jacob: jordan, were you working on both of the pdf's?
[21/10/20, 5:35:45 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep got both on the go.

We didn't really keep as much track of the meeting agendas as we should have.

But I'm gonna try bulk it up as much as possible.

But it is only 5 points for that whole side of things so if its not perfect it'll be one or two points.
[21/10/20, 5:37:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Meeting agenda is easy to make
[21/10/20, 5:37:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Reaching home
[21/10/20, 5:37:38 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah I'm just gonna go through and write down what was said basically
[21/10/20, 5:37:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 5:37:58 pm] Jacob: Wonderful.
[21/10/20, 5:38:13 pm] Jacob: Should I write the group reflection or has somebody done that too?
[21/10/20, 5:39:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea jake if you could please
[21/10/20, 5:42:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yes that's the one thing I think.
Maybe mention that we should have maybe got on github earlier
[21/10/20, 5:51:34 pm] Jacob: Yep sure, it’s a good point! Seems like we underestimated the task
[21/10/20, 5:59:21 pm] Jacob: So Ill be working on reflections, spark feedback and anything else that is needing attention still?
[21/10/20, 5:59:52 pm] Jacob: Thanks for your work today sneha and Jordan and sorry if I broke stuff in your code sneha!
[21/10/20, 6:00:47 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Maybe just have a look through the website and make sure nothing is broken
[21/10/20, 6:01:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jordan do we have a URL link
[21/10/20, 6:01:17 pm] Jacob: No worries.
[21/10/20, 6:02:30 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I do... give me one moment
[21/10/20, 6:03:52 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository/
[21/10/20, 6:04:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 6:04:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve uploaded it technologies on teams now
[21/10/20, 6:04:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: It has one pic IT technologies.jpg
[21/10/20, 6:05:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can someone please select another font for the HomePage text
[21/10/20, 6:05:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Doesn’t look great
[21/10/20, 6:06:50 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yep pic should already be up
[21/10/20, 6:07:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Behaviour test results footer needs to be changed from copyright Sneha Sathpathy to RMIT Pseudo Boomers
[21/10/20, 6:08:11 pm] Jordon O’Meara: So Jake and Murray you guys are the only ones left to sign the contributions form.

Let me know if you want me to sign for you
[21/10/20, 6:08:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Thanks ill do that now
[21/10/20, 6:08:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: # on ideal jobs - images need to be centered. First two pics are centered while the others are left alignment
[21/10/20, 6:09:21 pm] Jacob: Sign away jordan

‎[21/10/20, 6:12:41 pm] Jordon O’Meara: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 6:12:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Strange
[21/10/20, 6:13:39 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Not sure how or why the images are off centre though...

Could be a css thing.

Cause all the image parts were basically copy and paste from the two that are centred
‎[21/10/20, 6:14:01 pm] Jordon O’Meara: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 6:14:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: I know what’s up with the images
[21/10/20, 6:14:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: The have to be coded on the top section
[21/10/20, 6:15:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Give me 5
[21/10/20, 6:15:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll look at it
[21/10/20, 6:16:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ah cool. 
Let's hope it does wreck it again haha
[21/10/20, 6:16:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: IT tech section should be up soon.
[21/10/20, 6:16:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol i’ll get you to enter it from your end
[21/10/20, 6:31:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jordan for the centering of images in Ideal Jobs:
‎[21/10/20, 6:31:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
‎[21/10/20, 6:31:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 6:32:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: The images need to be within the <div id=“main”>
[21/10/20, 6:33:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: That will center the image
[21/10/20, 6:36:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ah
[21/10/20, 6:41:40 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Done
[21/10/20, 6:42:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Awesome 😎
[21/10/20, 6:42:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can we please just change the font on the homepage
[21/10/20, 6:42:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s looking terrible
[21/10/20, 6:42:43 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Jake let me know when the reflection bit is done. Ill need to grab that for the pdf.
[21/10/20, 6:43:10 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im terrible with fonts so im not making a choice on that
[21/10/20, 6:46:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Let me find it
[21/10/20, 6:46:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you just change it at your end
[21/10/20, 6:48:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Everything in IT work is coming up bold
[21/10/20, 6:48:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: Are you guys seeing the same thing
[21/10/20, 6:48:26 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah I'll try fix that now
[21/10/20, 6:48:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[21/10/20, 6:49:04 pm] Jacob: Yep jordan, will do

‎[21/10/20, 6:50:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/10/20, 6:50:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: IT technologies is coming to the left where as all the other pages are centered on the screen
[21/10/20, 6:51:51 pm] Jacob: The bold issue is because I didn’t close an h4
[21/10/20, 6:52:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😁
[21/10/20, 6:52:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: All good

[21/10/20, 6:52:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great job everyone
[21/10/20, 6:52:41 pm] Jacob: It was very late night!
[21/10/20, 6:52:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nah don’t stress
[21/10/20, 6:53:42 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I was looking for a <b> without a </b>.
[21/10/20, 6:53:43 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Fixed
[21/10/20, 6:54:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Fantastic

[21/10/20, 7:06:14 pm] Jordon O’Meara: We don't have a recording for one soo?
[21/10/20, 7:06:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: We didn’t have that many official meetings as we so regularly
[21/10/20, 7:06:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ah ok
[21/10/20, 7:09:07 pm] Jacob: Should we supplement it with our WhatsApp chat?
[21/10/20, 7:09:19 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah. Yeah I'm gonna put this in once we are done
[21/10/20, 7:09:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Absolutely
[21/10/20, 7:09:34 pm] Jacob: We will do better next time with teams
[21/10/20, 7:09:41 pm] Jacob: I’m including all that in the reflections
[21/10/20, 7:09:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: As we have constantly been on contact through whatsapp
[21/10/20, 7:09:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 7:10:03 pm] Jacob: Any other key points you want me to address that wasn’t in your individual reflections?
[21/10/20, 7:10:18 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Probably a good idea for us to have a read through the criteria and stuff to check if we've missed anything
[21/10/20, 7:10:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe a line or two that we didn’t have that many formal meetings as we collaborated and constantly kept up-to-date with tasks on WhatsApp
[21/10/20, 7:11:04 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah that's smart
[21/10/20, 7:11:28 pm] Jacob: Yep nice
[21/10/20, 7:13:00 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ok. I think once the group reflection is done.
And on there. All I have to do is put this convo into the pdf and we are done? Basically
[21/10/20, 7:13:41 pm] Jacob: Beauty
[21/10/20, 7:14:06 pm] Jacob: I’ll read through the instructions after I finish typing
[21/10/20, 7:14:16 pm] Jordon O’Meara: What ill do is upload the whats app stuff to the github and then link to it in the pdf.
[21/10/20, 7:14:29 pm] Jacob: Did we get the it tools section and include everybody’s individual assignment 1 websites?
[21/10/20, 7:15:08 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Should work.
Might have a backup link aswell
[21/10/20, 7:16:43 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Oh I don't think so.
Ill add links to the about me page maybe. If everyone wants to send their A1 link?
If everyone is available to send it.

[21/10/20, 8:21:55 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Awesome
[21/10/20, 8:22:56 pm] Jacob: anybody have trouble getting into spark?
[21/10/20, 8:23:15 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Did you do the forget password thing?
[21/10/20, 8:23:33 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry for the late reply, Jordan
[21/10/20, 8:23:34 pm] Jacob: i requested password reset ages ago but havent received n email
[21/10/20, 8:23:36 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: https://rajaneeshsankarannair.github.io/assignment1/home.html
[21/10/20, 8:23:56 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Strange. Try again. Check junk?
[21/10/20, 8:23:58 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: It’s really a bad one 😩
[21/10/20, 8:24:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I thought I didn't get it either but was looking in the wrong email address.
[21/10/20, 8:24:30 pm] Jordon O’Meara: No such thing as a bad one raj
[21/10/20, 8:26:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you for that 🙂🙂🙂
[21/10/20, 8:28:38 pm] Jacob: third time worked!
[21/10/20, 8:28:51 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Woo
[21/10/20, 8:29:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Okay website is done.
Pdf1 is done.
Now its just the pdf with all the meeting stuff.

Great work everyone. We are almost there
[21/10/20, 8:29:58 pm] Jacob: Gosh this is awful, I don’t want to judge you guys!
[21/10/20, 8:30:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Minutes is also nearly done
[21/10/20, 8:32:45 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I think Sneha and Jordan had very few hours of sleep this week... 🙁
[21/10/20, 8:32:59 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: All are working seriously hard
[21/10/20, 8:33:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks raj 😊

[21/10/20, 8:33:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: So sweet
[21/10/20, 8:34:18 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ❤️😍
[21/10/20, 8:34:24 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah spark plus is crap
[21/10/20, 8:34:59 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I struggled a lot to fix it up
[21/10/20, 8:35:37 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 5stars for everyone 🙂
[21/10/20, 8:52:01 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I have submitted the contribution form.
[21/10/20, 8:52:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Another couple mins jordan and then meeting minutes all done

[21/10/20, 9:14:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Fantastic
[21/10/20, 9:14:32 pm] Jacob: 🙌
[21/10/20, 9:14:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: So we dont need to submit anything from our end
[21/10/20, 9:14:40 pm] Jacob: Love your work guys
[21/10/20, 9:14:51 pm] Jacob: We just need to do spark?
[21/10/20, 9:15:16 pm] Ben: Awesome job finishing everything up guys, amazing effort all round! 😁
[21/10/20, 9:16:00 pm] Jordon O’Meara: All you guys need to do is spark plus and we are all good
[21/10/20, 9:16:10 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I double checked with Anthony earlier
[21/10/20, 9:16:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[21/10/20, 9:16:46 pm] Jacob: Cool I’m doing spark plus but it sucks, every time you move one thing it moves all the other ones!
[21/10/20, 9:17:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea its weird as
[21/10/20, 9:20:01 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah. It is frustrating
[21/10/20, 9:23:53 pm] Jacob: Now.....programming assisgnment 2! Haha
[21/10/20, 9:24:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: I haven’t even looked at that yet
[21/10/20, 9:25:00 pm] Jacob: Me neither. I still haven’t finished the iie from last week
[21/10/20, 9:28:17 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Same. I havent looked at this week for anything. Sunday night is gonna be cramming the last 3 weeks of both classes.

I couldn't get my IIE6 to work.
I emailed Srikanth and he spent 2hrs today trying to work out why it wasn't working for me. Apparently he worked it out but i haven't had a chance to look
[21/10/20, 9:30:14 pm] Jacob: I think I need to go back to week 6 too and start again...
[21/10/20, 9:33:35 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah that's basically what I've been doing.
[21/10/20, 9:33:47 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Week 6 seemed to be a big jump in difficulty
[21/10/20, 9:47:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup absolutely
[21/10/20, 9:48:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: All of a sudden week 6 onwards i was like what??
[21/10/20, 9:48:41 pm] Jacob: Yeah...is this what it’s going to be like for three years now?
[21/10/20, 9:49:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Haha hope not
[21/10/20, 9:53:03 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im thinking for next study period instead of doing the committing to the whole course I might just do the open enrolment route and do one subject at a time
[21/10/20, 9:55:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: How does the open enrolment route work
[21/10/20, 9:56:52 pm] Jordon O’Meara: My understanding is you just enrol one subject at a time. And then when you have done all the subjects required you apply for the accreditation.
I read it on the OUA site at some point
[21/10/20, 9:57:08 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Cause the idea of doing just 1 subject at a time seems soooo much more manageable
[21/10/20, 9:59:36 pm] Jacob: Yeah that could be a good option if you are full time working
[21/10/20, 10:00:48 pm] Jacob: I’ve been trying to cut down to 3 days but I don’t have kids to feed
[21/10/20, 10:14:58 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah.  If I could afford it I'd happily drop some hours ha
[21/10/20, 10:20:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: I feel your pain Jordan. Im in the same boat
[21/10/20, 10:21:05 pm] Sneha RMIT: But keep fingers crossed that my knowledge base in increases with time so that i can keep up with the workload
[21/10/20, 10:21:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: I find the weekly IIE’s a bit too much
[21/10/20, 10:21:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: I get that’s for learning but it all gets too tight in schedule
[21/10/20, 10:23:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah. I only really have a day to get it done sometimes
‎[22/10/20, 2:34:48 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted
[22/10/20, 2:35:35 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you all for your enormous hard work and dedication....
[22/10/20, 12:10:56 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning all, I know all are exhausted...
[22/10/20, 12:14:19 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Can I do something for you all? Can I prepare materials for module 7.2.1
‎[22/10/20, 12:14:25 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[22/10/20, 12:14:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Morning all
[22/10/20, 12:14:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Good point raj. We probably should start looking into the next assessment
[22/10/20, 12:15:37 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes. I can do it if you want Sneha
[22/10/20, 12:16:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is it for this one?

‎[22/10/20, 12:17:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[22/10/20, 12:18:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea sounds good Raj 😊
[22/10/20, 12:18:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Let me know if you need any help
[22/10/20, 12:19:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry I thought you were referring to assignment 3
[22/10/20, 12:19:33 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: You know what , I didn’t look at Assignment3
[22/10/20, 12:19:43 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤓
[22/10/20, 12:20:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I was talking to the module...
[22/10/20, 12:20:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: I had a brief look last night. It goes further onto project with the same team
[22/10/20, 12:20:29 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh I see...
[22/10/20, 12:20:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol ya I realised a little late
[22/10/20, 12:20:59 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll go through assignments 3 today .
[22/10/20, 12:21:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cool 👍
[22/10/20, 12:21:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hey Sneha, Assignment 3 also group work or ?
[22/10/20, 12:21:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup
[22/10/20, 12:21:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh cool. Thanks .
[22/10/20, 12:21:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think pretty much all the assessments is in a team
[22/10/20, 12:23:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you so much for your efforts 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[22/10/20, 12:23:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks. I think we all worked really well as a team
[22/10/20, 12:23:48 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes . True . Worked very hard
[22/10/20, 12:23:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Each person showed initiative and has their own set of strengths
[22/10/20, 12:24:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Introduction of Programming is getting worst 🙁
[22/10/20, 12:24:48 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Plenty of things to do
[22/10/20, 12:24:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m looking at finding a tutor
[22/10/20, 12:25:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im scratching my head on so many concepts
[22/10/20, 12:25:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Last thing i want is to spend the next 3 years being absolutely blank
[22/10/20, 12:25:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I think we can have 4 hour of free tuition with open university
[22/10/20, 12:25:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh really
[22/10/20, 12:26:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m not sure but i definitely need that
[22/10/20, 12:26:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: How do you get a tutor
[22/10/20, 12:26:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I think so , I’ll check and let you know
[22/10/20, 12:26:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’d definitely love to look into that
[22/10/20, 12:26:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks a million raj
[22/10/20, 12:26:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[22/10/20, 12:27:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m going to have one too
[22/10/20, 12:27:39 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Lunch time is over . Will catch up soon.
[22/10/20, 12:27:59 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: New job. It’s punctual place . I hate it
[22/10/20, 12:28:10 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣
[22/10/20, 12:29:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂
[22/10/20, 12:30:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: My boss also recommended looking into Linkdin Learning
[22/10/20, 12:34:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Here we go

‎[22/10/20, 12:42:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[22/10/20, 5:00:12 pm] Jacob: Hey Raj, is that the module we started with umera? I wrote something on discussion module there that you can use too if you want to include it
[22/10/20, 5:17:10 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh cool.. 😍 Jacob...
[26/10/20, 8:06:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys, can we organise a meeting time for the third assessment
[26/10/20, 8:06:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lets get into it
[26/10/20, 8:38:56 pm] Jacob: Yep cool let’s do it. I’m available tuesday evening, Thursday evening, Friday any time, Saturday afternoon....Sunday not sure yet
[26/10/20, 8:48:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great. Any evening works for me too
[26/10/20, 8:50:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: A quick understanding I gathered from today’s tute is that A3 is a bit like creating a busines plan (developing on project management skills).
[26/10/20, 8:50:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: - risk analsis, project schedule of work etc
[26/10/20, 10:35:49 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good evening all. I’m available Tuesday evening 🙏🏼
[27/10/20, 7:56:19 am] Jacob: Woops, I was mistaken and I’m not free tonight, sorry! All the other evenings are fine though!
[27/10/20, 11:38:22 am] Jordon O’Meara: Hey sorry I've been MIA. Im unavailable tonight but tomorrow works for me?
[27/10/20, 2:18:06 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes - I’m available for tomorrow as well
[27/10/20, 2:18:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Me too
[27/10/20, 2:18:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can we make it please around 7pm
[27/10/20, 2:33:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes 🤝
[27/10/20, 4:54:03 pm] Jacob: 👍
[27/10/20, 4:59:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you schedule a team meeting on teams calendar so that we can use that as evidence
[27/10/20, 5:41:32 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Sneha- I scheduled a meeting first time in Microsoft Team. Let me know whether it’s okey or not .. apologies if it’s wrong
[27/10/20, 6:07:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[28/10/20, 7:31:54 am] Jordon O’Meara: I may be missing the meeting
I've been sick all week (covid tested Monday, results negative) and I've woken up today, from almost no sleep, feeling like I have a tennis ball in my throat and at this stage almost no voice. Gonna try sleep and hopefully im feeling better by meeting time
[28/10/20, 9:49:27 am] Jacob: No worries, take it easy Jordan
[28/10/20, 9:50:23 am] Sneha RMIT: Take it easy jordan. Get well soon.
[28/10/20, 2:22:33 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Get well soon , brother... 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[28/10/20, 2:43:13 pm] Ben: 7pm tonight guys?

And get well soon Jordan man!
[28/10/20, 6:13:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys are we still doing today or another time whenever everyone is free?
[28/10/20, 6:39:08 pm] Jacob: How is everybody feeling about it? I am a bit overwhelmed by this programming assignment and haven’t had a chance to really look over the IT one properly yet, so I don’t think I will have much to contribute right now, but I am more than happy to do it tonight still if you guys are feeling more organised!
[28/10/20, 6:39:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey jake, totally hear you
[28/10/20, 6:40:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Same here . I didn’t even listen Umera’s last lecture 🙁
[28/10/20, 6:40:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ive literally been struggling to keep my head up with the IIE’s and then the assignment
[28/10/20, 6:41:09 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha, did you managed to organise a tuition for Programming?
[28/10/20, 6:41:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: I got one from india and he ended up being useless 😂
[28/10/20, 6:41:54 pm] Jacob: Seems like we are feeling a bit the same then!
[28/10/20, 6:42:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: So trying to find someone
[28/10/20, 6:42:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I usually play tutor chat more than 10-10 times to understand half of it
[28/10/20, 6:42:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup absolutely
[28/10/20, 6:42:47 pm] Jacob: yeah me too! gayan's tutor chat's are pretty helpful too
[28/10/20, 6:42:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve bern finding that different topics different tutors teach better than others
[28/10/20, 6:43:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Absolutely
[28/10/20, 6:43:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: True Jacob.. You know what , I couldn’t work console base UI in IEE 8 😂
[28/10/20, 6:43:35 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Im glad im not the only one struggling.
[28/10/20, 6:44:32 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I couldn't get IIE6 to work.
And still trying to do 7.
Thinking of just focusing on the assignment and trying to get an okay score on that and getting 0s on the IIEs
[28/10/20, 6:44:34 pm] Jacob: I havent looked at number 8 yet, my tutor advised mt to not worry about them until i have done the assignment
[28/10/20, 6:44:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I shaved my head bcoz I scratch my head everywhere
[28/10/20, 6:44:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: I wanted to get a extension as im not confident that i can finish by weekend. But weird thing is gayan not your tutor makes that decision
[28/10/20, 6:44:49 pm] Jacob: haha
[28/10/20, 6:45:05 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Like a cat scratch
[28/10/20, 6:45:11 pm] Jacob: jordan, i think we still get marks if submit just anything for the iie's
[28/10/20, 6:45:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😁😂😂😂 good 👀 look
[28/10/20, 6:45:45 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I emailed gayan yesterday to ask about an extension.
Cause I basically have today and Sunday night to get it done and I have been in bed all day
[28/10/20, 6:46:10 pm] Jacob: you gotta stop eating tennis balls jordan
[28/10/20, 6:46:19 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Wife kicked me out yesterday from bed room in the middle of the night bcoz I was chanting some programming loudly
[28/10/20, 6:46:20 pm] Jordon O’Meara: But it looks like ill be having a sick day from work tomorrow to go to the doctor so hopefully I'm feeling a bit better and can get some done
[28/10/20, 6:46:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hahah
[28/10/20, 6:46:21 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 😂
[28/10/20, 6:46:22 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ha yeah
[28/10/20, 6:46:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[28/10/20, 6:46:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Haha
[28/10/20, 6:46:40 pm] Jacob: hahaha
[28/10/20, 6:46:50 pm] Jacob: it's invading our dreams!
[28/10/20, 6:47:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe like the last assignment he will give an extension for everyone
[28/10/20, 6:47:30 pm] Jacob: maybe if he knows how everybody is feeling
[28/10/20, 6:47:52 pm] Jacob: he probably thinks it's easy haha
[28/10/20, 6:47:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Haha
[28/10/20, 6:48:25 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes - 😂 you know red error lines everywhere in my dreams
[28/10/20, 6:48:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im dieing. At work im a zombie from just trying to keep up.
[28/10/20, 6:48:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: Tonight i’m going to try to learn to make things look a bit more fancy
[28/10/20, 6:49:11 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls come teams if you guys are free
[28/10/20, 6:50:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol im sure there will be a silence raj. Everyone seems absolutely drained
[28/10/20, 7:06:27 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi there , meeting time !

[28/10/20, 7:12:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Raj we aren’t doing it today anymore
[28/10/20, 7:14:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh.. I see
[28/10/20, 7:14:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I didn’t know
[28/10/20, 7:14:09 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 😂
[28/10/20, 7:14:21 pm] Jacob: sorry Raj
[28/10/20, 7:14:39 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: No problem.. when is it our next meeting , tomorrow?

[2/11/20, 10:11:12 am] Jacob: Hi everybody, how are you all?
[2/11/20, 10:12:47 am] Jordon O’Meara: I am still not 100% but good. 
Have decided im gonna risk failing programming and focus more on  IT.
Worse case I re do programming next study period.

So when should we have our meeting and get started on A3
[2/11/20, 10:15:35 am] Jacob: Yeah i bet it’s  pretty tough juggling everything, you seem really busy!
[2/11/20, 10:16:00 am] Jacob: I’m going away for 5 days from Friday so would be good to have a meeting before then
[2/11/20, 10:16:20 am] Jacob: I’m gonna take my computer so I can try to keep up though
[2/11/20, 10:16:52 am] Jacob: It’s due on 22nd November so we have 3 weeks
[2/11/20, 10:17:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys
[2/11/20, 10:18:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning All 🙏🏼
[2/11/20, 10:18:11 am] Sneha RMIT: I hear you jordan. I’m upto my neck with work.
[2/11/20, 10:18:24 am] Jacob: Morning guys
[2/11/20, 10:18:26 am] Sneha RMIT: Intro to programming with every week IIEs is just too much
[2/11/20, 10:18:46 am] Sneha RMIT: Absolutely struggling to keep on top of stuff
[2/11/20, 10:18:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Same here Jordan . I’m going to call 000 for some help to fix java issues 😩
[2/11/20, 10:19:29 am] Sneha RMIT: I applied for an extension for the assignment yesterday as i have been having severe migraine attacks
[2/11/20, 10:19:39 am] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂😂
[2/11/20, 10:19:53 am] Sneha RMIT: If you have any luck then let me know as well
[2/11/20, 10:20:21 am] Sneha RMIT: I had sent a invite for a meeting on this Wednesday
[2/11/20, 10:20:21 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Working 15 hrs everyday on weekends. My eyes are like kookaburra
[2/11/20, 10:20:31 am] Sneha RMIT: Oh geez
[2/11/20, 10:20:34 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Bloody red
[2/11/20, 10:20:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Seems like we all are in the same boat
[2/11/20, 10:20:59 am] Jacob: How do we find the invite? Is it in teams?
[2/11/20, 10:21:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: My wife said , I don’t any costume for Halloween party
[2/11/20, 10:21:12 am] Sneha RMIT: I had to get a babysitter in the weekend so i could focus on studying
[2/11/20, 10:21:20 am] Sneha RMIT: Hahahha
[2/11/20, 10:21:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jacob. Yes . I sent invitation last week, Jacob
[2/11/20, 10:23:07 am] Jacob: Oh ok cool so when does everybody feel ready to try again?
[2/11/20, 10:24:01 am] Jordon O’Meara: Wednesday works for me. Gives me time to catch up on modules and stuff before then.
[2/11/20, 10:24:33 am] Sneha RMIT: Wednesday works for me too
[2/11/20, 10:24:56 am] Sneha RMIT: 7pm?
[2/11/20, 10:25:11 am] Jordon O’Meara: Its actually kinda funny.
At the start programming was the course I felt like I liked most.
And had kinda wished I'd just done the one subject at a time.

And then now since working with you guys it's the other way around.
If rather do IT than programming
[2/11/20, 10:25:12 am] Jacob: That’s good for me
[2/11/20, 10:25:16 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Wednesday is okey for me. Can we do it around 6.30 pm? I have my program tutor chat at 7.00
[2/11/20, 10:25:25 am] Jacob: Same jordan!
[2/11/20, 10:25:34 am] Sneha RMIT: So so spot on
[2/11/20, 10:25:38 am] Jacob: We have much more support here
[2/11/20, 10:25:55 am] Sneha RMIT: I love the subject. But needs a shit of time. Much like a baby
[2/11/20, 10:26:13 am] Jacob: I think I’d really enjoy programming a lot more if that was all I had to worry about
[2/11/20, 10:26:25 am] Sneha RMIT: Absolutely
[2/11/20, 10:26:38 am] Jacob: I’m happy with 6.30 Raj
[2/11/20, 10:26:58 am] Sneha RMIT: There is so much to learn. And at the moment because of time pressure im just scrapping the surface of the topics
[2/11/20, 10:27:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: True. It’s a disaster to study programming in online . We need to discuss, tutors should show in real life
[2/11/20, 10:27:22 am] Sneha RMIT: Guys I struggle with 6.30 as im rushing from work
[2/11/20, 10:27:31 am] Jacob: Yeah  I wish we could meet and help each other with our code
[2/11/20, 10:27:38 am] Sneha RMIT: If we could do 7pm Melbourne time it could be great
[2/11/20, 10:27:44 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I feel like study programming in online is like study swimming online
[2/11/20, 10:27:55 am] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂😂
[2/11/20, 10:27:57 am] Jacob: Works for me, we can keep it short Raj
[2/11/20, 10:28:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Don’t worry - I’m watching recording 15 times anyway
[2/11/20, 10:28:34 am] Jacob: Sneha you made an agenda didn’t you? If we stick to that we can be done on time
[2/11/20, 10:28:40 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea
[2/11/20, 10:29:06 am] Sneha RMIT: I jotted down a couple of points on the calendar invite i sent
[2/11/20, 10:29:24 am] Jacob: Oh what is calendar invite?
[2/11/20, 10:29:41 am] Sneha RMIT: I sent one last week on teams
[2/11/20, 10:29:50 am] Sneha RMIT: For this Wednesday 7pm
[2/11/20, 10:29:59 am] Jacob: Oh righto
[2/11/20, 10:30:08 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 😍
[2/11/20, 10:30:15 am] Jacob: I just got an email, I’ll look at it more closely!
[2/11/20, 10:31:12 am] Jacob: So we are all set for Wednesday already, good job!
[2/11/20, 10:31:27 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, do you know any java tuition teachers ?
[2/11/20, 10:31:56 am] Jacob: No, sorry!
[2/11/20, 10:32:18 am] Rajaneesh Nair: It’s okey 🤝
[2/11/20, 10:32:41 am] Sneha RMIT: Apparently I recently here on udemy.com you can get tutors
[2/11/20, 10:32:51 am] Sneha RMIT: Heard sorry
[2/11/20, 10:33:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Awesome Sneha 🙏🏼 thank you
[2/11/20, 10:34:05 am] Sneha RMIT: 😊
[2/11/20, 1:52:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: So i applied for an extension with the special consideration team who manage the extensions at the moment. And after providing a medical certificate they want now a impact statement from a doctor
[2/11/20, 1:54:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: I emailed gayan and now the teaching staff are going to have a meeting with them.
[2/11/20, 1:55:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: I told them that if it was so hard to get a couple of days extra, then no student would be able to request a extension
[2/11/20, 1:55:18 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh great... fingers crossed...
[2/11/20, 1:55:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😁🤞
[2/11/20, 1:56:36 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I watch YouTube channels to overcome this Java Tsunami
[2/11/20, 1:57:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Did it work
[2/11/20, 1:57:35 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes . It is working perfectly. Internet is very good here 🤣
[2/11/20, 1:57:47 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: But I couldn’t learn anything
[2/11/20, 2:07:23 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I emailed gayan a week and a half ago and he never replied.
[2/11/20, 2:11:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh really
[2/11/20, 2:12:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol he responded probably because i wrote a essay on how the system is flawed and doesn’t assist students studying online juggling multiple commitments
[2/11/20, 2:18:13 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah I'm actually really disappointed with the communication from him.
Sent the same email to srikanth and had an email back in about 30mins
[2/11/20, 2:18:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Srikanth is really good
[2/11/20, 2:18:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: I told him.. do you work 24/7 😂
[2/11/20, 2:19:17 pm] Jordon O’Meara: But his reply was basically that I needed to speak to gayan
[2/11/20, 2:19:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: But truly it’s terrible in terms of putting your hand up and saying i need a extra day or two. Even if you give all the documents, the team just says na
[2/11/20, 2:20:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: And funny thing is even Gayan doesn’t have control over extensions. It has to go through the Special Condition team who really dont know what they’re on about
[2/11/20, 2:21:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: For a second i felt like saying im a psychologist and I wouldn’t be handing out impact statements for 1-2 day extension otherwise i’d be writing reports all day long
[2/11/20, 2:24:30 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah exactly
[2/11/20, 4:59:45 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
‎[2/11/20, 5:01:13 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[2/11/20, 5:01:54 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: My tutor won’t give any response during the weekend🙁
[2/11/20, 5:03:46 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: But he’s nice, expert to fix my issues
[2/11/20, 5:04:13 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry to hear thar Sneha 🙁
[2/11/20, 5:04:34 pm] Ben: I'm good for 6:30 on Wednesday too! Just throwing it out there haha
[4/11/20, 5:03:05 pm] Jordon O’Meara: So do we have a plan for a meeting?
[4/11/20, 5:30:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes, Jordan
[4/11/20, 5:30:21 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I think so
[4/11/20, 5:30:52 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: How are You Now
[4/11/20, 5:31:51 pm] Jordon O’Meara: We do need to get started.

Im mostly better. Still not 100% but I'm alive.

I've officially withdrawn from programming and re enrolled for next study period. So I can focus on this fully
[4/11/20, 5:34:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Great decision. I’m planning to do the same . It’s too much for me to understand bloody java
[4/11/20, 5:34:54 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah. The stress of knowing programming is there is just making it harder to do anything.
[4/11/20, 5:35:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I spent plenty of hours but worth nothing .. I couldn’t find a tuition teacher as well
[4/11/20, 5:36:52 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes same here, Jordan
[4/11/20, 5:37:37 pm] Jordon O’Meara: At least we will have a head start on the first few IIEs when we do it agaib
[4/11/20, 6:31:49 pm] Jacob: 7pm right guys?
[4/11/20, 6:33:07 pm] Ben: I thought we were going to do 6:30? Didn't someone have a meeting at 7?
[4/11/20, 6:33:50 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah i an unsure
[4/11/20, 6:34:31 pm] Ben: Are you guys free at the moment then?
[4/11/20, 6:35:18 pm] Jacob: yep im free for the next hour
[4/11/20, 6:35:44 pm] Ben: Sweet, I set up the meeting so if anyone is free feel free
[4/11/20, 6:36:17 pm] Jacob: cool 2 secs
[4/11/20, 7:14:57 pm] Jacob: Only 3 of us were in the meeting and we basically just read through the assignment 3. I made a new file called assignment 3 to do list, please, everybody read through the assignment 3 document and add any tasks that you think we need to do. Hopefully we can have a meeting with all of us in the next couple of days and get a bit more direction
[4/11/20, 7:28:15 pm] Murray: Sorry guys I’m still stuck on a work call :(. Sorry been quiet for the past week as well. Been crazy but sounds like you guys have had a rough couple as well.

Programming is a nightmare.
[4/11/20, 7:29:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys, i’m still here at work till 9.30pm
[4/11/20, 7:29:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Asked to stay back
[5/11/20, 9:52:42 am] Jordon O’Meara: Sorry guys had a screaming 5 year old to deal with
[5/11/20, 2:54:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Seems like it was one of those days for quite a few of us
[5/11/20, 2:54:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: I came back home to three rooms ceilings dripping water
‎[5/11/20, 2:55:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[5/11/20, 2:55:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: Our air con unit pads feel off on the roof and it was raining so it seeped into the ceiling
‎[5/11/20, 2:55:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[5/11/20, 2:56:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: No shortage of entertainment at our end 😅
[5/11/20, 3:02:03 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Oh wow that sucks
[5/11/20, 3:16:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😅 yup didn’t need to watch the tele yesterday. Enough drama for one evening
[5/11/20, 6:27:13 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Omg, sorry to hear that Sneha 🙁
[5/11/20, 6:27:38 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Fixing is bloody expensive too
[5/11/20, 6:29:56 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: May be because of heavy winds...
[6/11/20, 1:52:13 am] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys our marks have come back. We got 74%
[6/11/20, 1:52:26 am] Sneha RMIT: However we didn’t get any marks for feedback
[6/11/20, 1:52:44 am] Sneha RMIT: I think we have been marked incorrectly for this section
‎[6/11/20, 1:52:49 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[6/11/20, 8:25:58 am] Jordon O’Meara: Very strange
[6/11/20, 9:25:40 am] Jacob: Hey everybody, sorry everybody’s had a rough couple of weeks....
[6/11/20, 9:26:00 am] Jacob: Is that feedback the spark plus thing do you think?
[6/11/20, 9:33:06 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning
[6/11/20, 9:33:13 am] Sneha RMIT: Ya its the spark thing
[6/11/20, 9:33:20 am] Sneha RMIT: Which is why it makes no sense
[6/11/20, 9:33:28 am] Sneha RMIT: We all did ours
[6/11/20, 9:33:37 am] Jacob: Oh yeah that makes no sense if we all did it
‎[6/11/20, 9:35:03 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[6/11/20, 9:35:13 am] Sneha RMIT: That was essentially the break down
[6/11/20, 9:35:32 am] Sneha RMIT: How do we appeal or tell them about it
[6/11/20, 9:36:45 am] Jacob: I think where it was submitted on canvas you can reply to the feedback
[6/11/20, 9:37:33 am] Jordon O’Meara: Ill get on after work and look into it
[6/11/20, 9:38:27 am] Jacob: Not sure exactly where, but I remember it being a thing that we were encouraged to reply to the feedback given if necessary
[6/11/20, 9:38:35 am] Jacob: For the last assignment
[6/11/20, 9:38:57 am] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah I know where to do it. Ill follow up this afternoon
[6/11/20, 9:39:07 am] Jacob: Awesome 👍
[6/11/20, 9:39:22 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jordan 😊
[6/11/20, 9:39:55 am] Jacob: We need to organise a meeting too
[6/11/20, 9:40:09 am] Jacob: This assignment seems big and we are running out of time
[6/11/20, 9:42:31 am] Jordon O’Meara: Sunday night is my next available time
[6/11/20, 9:47:09 am] Jacob: Alright let’s try then 👍
[6/11/20, 9:59:27 am] Sneha RMIT: Great that would be good
‎[6/11/20, 10:18:07 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[6/11/20, 10:18:14 am] Sneha RMIT: I put this comment in
[6/11/20, 10:19:34 am] Sneha RMIT: My bad there was some typo 🤦‍♀️
[6/11/20, 10:19:41 am] Jacob: Nice sneha. You are a people person!
[6/11/20, 10:20:01 am] Sneha RMIT: 😊 thanks jake
[6/11/20, 10:20:16 am] Sneha RMIT: Hope that gets sorted out
[6/11/20, 10:20:24 am] Sneha RMIT: We are sitting on nearly HD
[6/11/20, 10:20:36 am] Sneha RMIT: You guys should be proud of yourselves
[6/11/20, 10:20:43 am] Sneha RMIT: Great effort

[6/11/20, 11:28:25 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Congratulations and thank you all for your outstanding efforts
[6/11/20, 11:38:39 am] Jordon O’Meara: Wooo great work everyone
[6/11/20, 12:22:04 pm] Jacob: Wow awesome news!
[6/11/20, 1:34:42 pm] Murray: Yea awesome work everyone!
[6/11/20, 3:44:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys i need some help. I have to give my programming assignment in tomorrow. I have a silly question to ask
[6/11/20, 3:44:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: I knw the answer yet still confused
[6/11/20, 3:44:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Whats the difference between single and multi class
[6/11/20, 3:46:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im getting confused between what is taught in week 8 and 9
[6/11/20, 3:58:31 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/11/20, 3:59:07 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha- we had only one page (one class)  from IEE 01 to IEE06 . Now have several pages or classes from IEE07 onwards like Back end , Front end Gterm UI, front end Consol, Application etc
[6/11/20, 3:59:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok great
[6/11/20, 3:59:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: So its pretty easy in that case
[6/11/20, 3:59:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: We need only one class for A2
[6/11/20, 3:59:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes
[6/11/20, 3:59:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Pretty much a revision of what we did in the IIE’s
[6/11/20, 4:00:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh phew
[6/11/20, 4:00:16 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes - you are really on track
[6/11/20, 4:00:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve been constantly going through all the recordings and it didn’t have much on the multi classes and i was feeling so dumb
[6/11/20, 4:00:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks raj 😊 really appreciate it
[6/11/20, 4:01:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh - I had same issues. good luck Sneha🤝🤝
[6/11/20, 4:01:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[6/11/20, 4:02:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: Once this is done. Sunday focus on our group assignment
[6/11/20, 4:03:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok just another thing so what did he mean by two or more windows
[6/11/20, 4:03:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Does that mean like you have a message popping up with something and then you go into another window
[6/11/20, 4:04:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Are the message dialog boxes considered as windows
[6/11/20, 4:04:54 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Two windows should pop up when we run the program
[6/11/20, 4:05:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Meaning..
[6/11/20, 4:05:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: This is the confusion in my brain

[6/11/20, 4:09:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Where you add, remove and motify orders
[6/11/20, 4:09:45 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: There is two Gtem windows
1. gtMain
2. gtSub

[7/11/20, 1:21:56 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Tomorrow night I am available.
If my internet is fixed by then

[8/11/20, 6:38:24 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Hey sorry to be a pain. Don't think I'll make the meeting.
In the middle of a marital argument and probably won't be able to get on.
Please go ahead without me and assign me a task to do. I'm free Monday night until Thursday morning to do stuff so whatever you guys need I can do.
[8/11/20, 6:38:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: No worries jordan
[8/11/20, 6:38:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Focus on that
[8/11/20, 6:39:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: I know the strains of the immense amount of work overload
[8/11/20, 6:59:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: No worries , Jordan 🤝
[8/11/20, 6:59:41 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I couldn’t find the link to join the meeting 🙁
[8/11/20, 7:01:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys do we bave a link
[8/11/20, 7:02:21 pm] Murray: I just started a call you guys should be able to join

[9/11/20, 10:45:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys, I’ve uploaded a document called schedule of work in a file i have created called Assignment 3 documents
[9/11/20, 11:39:22 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Superb & Thank you Sneha 🙏🏼
[9/11/20, 11:42:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: We need to do a lot!
[9/11/20, 11:43:10 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I definitely need a tuition for this task. 🤣🤣
[9/11/20, 11:48:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: But we will finish it on time
[9/11/20, 6:31:24 pm] Murray: Hey guys we all still good for a call at 645?
[9/11/20, 6:31:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup 😊

[9/11/20, 6:49:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys we are on teams now
[9/11/20, 6:50:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: On teams page
‎[9/11/20, 6:50:37 pm] Murray: ‎image omitted
[9/11/20, 7:19:39 pm] Murray: Hey All,

As discussed in the call. We have now assigned sections to group memebers to work on with a due date of this Sunday 730pm NSW/VIC time. This was very rough and was difficult to really get a good reading on how much work is needed for each section. If you have a read and find your section is massive let the group know people with smaller sections can put their hands up to help.

I have put a meeting to catchup and see how we are going for 8pm on Thursday into our calendars. There is also one in there for Sunday. Let me know if you can't see the invites.

Cheers!
[9/11/20, 8:23:54 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you so much Muz🤝🙏🏼
[9/11/20, 9:03:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Ben,
I am working on unreal engine and start working on storyboard but I have some question. 

According to the project , that who’s playing with the heroin? With Her mind or ?
[9/11/20, 9:08:02 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: How the player gains the points? By Answering the questions from her mind?
[9/11/20, 9:08:17 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Kindly guide me.
[10/11/20, 4:46:57 pm] Ben: Thanks all, sorry I have worked like triple shifts the last 2 days 😅

I'll go through a bunch tonight and start on what I can. 

Raj, the game isn't one with a "point" system so much from what I was thinking. It is entirely story based, the player is in charge of the character from a first person view. The idea is as you progress, the character starts seeing more delusions, and the settings become more and more abstract as they get more and more lost in there "world".
I had ideas about trying to use voices in the head which the player hears and influences actions, stuff like that. But I hadn't exactly fleshed it all out that much honestly. The story, mechanics and whatnot need to really be ironed out.
[10/11/20, 5:01:18 pm] Ben: Also Raj, are you free Thursday or Friday Arvos to chat? I'm not free really until then, thanks work and life, but if we can catch-up for a bit we could really nail down the project description and everything as a whole.
[10/11/20, 5:06:09 pm] Jacob: I’d be keen to be involved then too Ben so we can nut out and define the ‘aim’ and a couple of ‘goals’ so I can write about them
[10/11/20, 5:07:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good evening all
[10/11/20, 5:08:04 pm] Ben: Yeah was just having a look, and that sounds good to me. Do feel free to start taking the story itself and molding it away from my single idea. The more ideas, the better, as well as my semi constructed ideas are far from going to be suitable enough to rely entirely on haha
[10/11/20, 5:08:32 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Definitely Ben. I’m free everyday after 4.00 pm
[10/11/20, 5:09:14 pm] Ben: Does Thursday or Friday around 4:30 work for you Jake?
[10/11/20, 5:10:10 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I read the the project many times . It’s really a great stuff
[10/11/20, 5:12:05 pm] Jacob: Yep I’ll be back from holidays and have proper internet and be ready to go! I’ll be home from work both days around that time too.
[10/11/20, 8:21:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great. Assignment due date has changed to 27nov
[10/11/20, 8:46:46 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Wow. That’s a good news
[10/11/20, 8:47:32 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Definitely can't complain about 5hat
[10/11/20, 8:47:38 pm] Jordon O’Meara: That*
[12/11/20, 6:01:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good eve , how  are you all
[12/11/20, 6:26:29 pm] Murray: Not bad Raj, yourself?
[12/11/20, 6:31:01 pm] Murray: Hey guys how are we tracking with everything? Do we still wanna meet this evening?
[12/11/20, 6:51:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Great to hear that Muz. I’m Having fun with new job 🙂
[12/11/20, 6:52:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Actually Ben , Jacob and me had a plan to catch up regarding our project work
[12/11/20, 6:54:12 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Luckily A3 submission date is 27nov. We have little bit time
[12/11/20, 6:55:13 pm] Murray: Ah ok. Well if you guys do that tonight we can put of the whole group until Sunday? I’m easy either way. Probably a lot for you guys to do both tonight haha.
[12/11/20, 6:55:33 pm] Jordon O’Meara: I've been busier than expected this week but have made a start.  Planning on getting it all done Sunday arvo
[12/11/20, 6:56:14 pm] Murray: 👌
[12/11/20, 6:56:32 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Great, Jordan 🤝

[12/11/20, 6:57:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Doing final touch ups
[12/11/20, 6:58:40 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I know , A3 for IT and programming will be a Disaster 😄😄
[12/11/20, 6:59:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I have one question, Where we will post our A3 works , Jordon?
[12/11/20, 7:00:30 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Can I creat a word document in team?
[12/11/20, 7:07:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I just created a empty word file - Assignment 3 draft inside the  *Assignment 3 document * folder
[12/11/20, 7:13:26 pm] Jordon O’Meara: 👍
[12/11/20, 7:13:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤝
[12/11/20, 7:36:24 pm] Murray: If we are all busy this evening then are we all happy to just cancel tonight and meet on Sunday?
[12/11/20, 7:47:21 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m free today but I know people are really busy. I’m happy with today or Sunday
[15/11/20, 6:54:54 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good evening guys .
[15/11/20, 6:55:23 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Do we have meeting tonight?
[16/11/20, 12:32:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hi guys, hope everyone is well. Really sorry zoned out this weekend and didn’t have my phone on me much as i was preoccupied with family diwali commitments 😐 will focus on the assessment this week.
[16/11/20, 12:46:17 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Yeah I'm half way through 11 days straight of work so I havent had the time i thought I'd have to get stuff done.

Meeting soon?
[16/11/20, 12:47:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey jordan. You poor thing. Seems like you’ve been going through a fair bit. Sure lets see what the others have planned.
[16/11/20, 12:47:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m behind on intro to IT
[16/11/20, 12:47:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: its like my body has just zoned out and i need to refocus
[16/11/20, 1:16:08 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Work is just hectic this time of year. We have mostly casuals and they always want time off this time of year.

Yeah I'm the same.
[16/11/20, 1:17:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Look we can only try our best. Hang in there. We’re all a team and we’ll get through these assessments through as well. Its just a patience game
[16/11/20, 1:28:17 pm] Jacob: Hi friends, sorry I have been absent too. When we were on kangaroo island we got engaged 😁! So my mind has been elsewhere. Ive been busy catching up at work after the holiday and I’ve been really trying to catch up on programming. With the IT, I honestly don’t know how to start so I’ve been a bit anxious about it.
[16/11/20, 1:29:57 pm] Jordon O’Meara: Ooo congrats
[16/11/20, 1:30:31 pm] Jacob: I just looked up what Diwali is and it sounds amazing, it’s a shame that our culture is so devoid of spirituality.
[16/11/20, 1:30:38 pm] Jacob: Thanks Jordan!

[17/11/20, 9:42:55 am] Jacob: Thanks Raj 🙏 Yes, it seems we have swapped with Melbourne! luckily i live in willunga, which is a town away from the city, so it feels safer. I will find out today if my job is affected by the new restrictions. But if I lose my job I will have some extra time to do the assignment!
[17/11/20, 9:49:27 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Glad to hear that you safe 😇 Yes, we had worst restrictions including curfews.
[18/11/20, 7:06:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good evening all, can we do a quick chat tomorrow or day after tomorrow evening?

[18/11/20, 7:25:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I could not understand the mark system
[18/11/20, 7:25:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: I got 98 for A1
and 80 for A2
[18/11/20, 7:25:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: But im behind on programming
[18/11/20, 7:26:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Overall to keep up with it all is just too overwhelming
[18/11/20, 7:26:20 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: How much mark you got out of 100 already?
[18/11/20, 7:26:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Full 9.8
[18/11/20, 7:26:40 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: We need 50 marks to pass, right?
[18/11/20, 7:27:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think somewhere around 85
[18/11/20, 7:27:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yes
[18/11/20, 7:27:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think we all will be absolutely fine

[18/11/20, 7:27:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls
[18/11/20, 7:27:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im more concerned that its going to be like this for all subjects
[18/11/20, 7:28:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: You would have easily crossed 60%
[18/11/20, 7:28:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Dont stress
[18/11/20, 7:28:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just hand everything in
[18/11/20, 7:28:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s the most important thing
[18/11/20, 7:29:05 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you so much , Sneha 😇

[18/11/20, 7:30:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Can hire someone to do our job 🤣 I’m just kidding
[18/11/20, 7:31:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Especially with intro to programming. The weekly activities doesn’t give you any breather
[18/11/20, 7:31:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hahah if you find them let me know 😂😂
[18/11/20, 7:31:38 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤝🤣
[18/11/20, 7:31:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: I couldn’t even find a decent java tutor
[18/11/20, 7:32:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: They all seemed to waffle around
[18/11/20, 7:33:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: My program tutor is absolutely Disaster
[18/11/20, 7:33:42 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hopeless. Really not all care about students feeling ...
[18/11/20, 7:33:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: At least you got some idea about the assignment 3
[18/11/20, 7:34:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think they are all a bit like that
[18/11/20, 7:34:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: If your new then your seen as dumb
[18/11/20, 7:34:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Honestly I didn’t started A3
[18/11/20, 7:34:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: May be on Friday
[18/11/20, 7:35:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe we should have a group meeting for that 😅
[18/11/20, 7:35:28 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: That’s really a good idea
[18/11/20, 7:35:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lets do it. Anyone else interested lets share ideas

[19/11/20, 9:25:06 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Terrible headache and chest pain
[19/11/20, 9:25:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s strange
[19/11/20, 9:25:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: What are the doctors saying
[19/11/20, 9:26:27 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Some nerve issues in brain
[19/11/20, 9:26:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: They are working on it. Had CT scan and all
[19/11/20, 9:26:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh no raj. Please takecare and keep us up to date with how you go

[20/11/20, 9:00:24 am] Sneha RMIT: We need a time where we all catch up. I know we all are roped up in multiple commitments but we’ve got to get through this
[20/11/20, 9:00:49 am] Sneha RMIT: Im going to dedicate this weekend to catch up
[20/11/20, 9:07:49 am] Jacob: Hi sneha, a little overwhelmed but now we are in lockdown in Adelaide so I have some time to focus on uni
[20/11/20, 9:08:19 am] Sneha RMIT: Geez you poor thing
[20/11/20, 9:08:35 am] Sneha RMIT: Seems a terrible time for you as well
[20/11/20, 9:08:56 am] Jacob: I really don’t know where to start on A3 though but I really don’t want to have to repeat the course
[20/11/20, 9:09:49 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok you know what i’m going to sit down today and just reassess everything
[20/11/20, 9:10:17 am] Sneha RMIT: We might just need to informally keep bothering each other
[20/11/20, 9:10:37 am] Jacob: Yeah we need to do something!
[20/11/20, 9:10:43 am] Sneha RMIT: Just set up a meeting on teams so it looks like we had a formal catch up
[20/11/20, 9:11:43 am] Sneha RMIT: Don’t worry we wont fail. Its just too much work load. Im not sure how they expect online students to get through so much workload
[20/11/20, 9:12:45 am] Sneha RMIT: Today i’ll see what all i can get done on the list
[20/11/20, 9:13:51 am] Jacob: Okay and I’m free for meetings anytime now!
[20/11/20, 9:14:09 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[20/11/20, 9:14:44 am] Sneha RMIT: Lets do a quick catch up tomorrow sometime. I’ll going to blindly start working on the assignment
[20/11/20, 9:15:09 am] Sneha RMIT: Can you please create a document on teams like last time so everyone can work on it
[20/11/20, 9:15:26 am] Jacob: I think there’s one there already

[20/11/20, 9:24:30 am] Jacob: Sounds good to me
[20/11/20, 9:24:54 am] Jacob: Poor thing Raj, is there any idea of what is wrong?
[20/11/20, 9:25:12 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Some blockage in brain
[20/11/20, 9:25:20 am] Jacob: Crikey
[20/11/20, 9:25:26 am] Rajaneesh Nair: In nerves
[20/11/20, 9:26:32 am] Jacob: I hope you get well soon 🙏
[20/11/20, 9:27:05 am] Jacob: Probably stressing about assignments won’t help, you should send that photo to the university
[20/11/20, 9:28:13 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes, Jacob.
[20/11/20, 9:28:25 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[20/11/20, 9:35:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, we need to prepare a storyboard for our project. How we make that? By writing or designing through unreal engine software?
[20/11/20, 9:41:07 am] Jacob: Not sure. Ben was talking about unreal engine, but it can be anything
[20/11/20, 9:41:18 am] Jacob: If anybody is good at drawing for example
[20/11/20, 9:52:11 am] Jacob: I set up GitHub and sent invites to all except Murray cause I don’t have your GitHub name
[20/11/20, 10:35:44 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jacob
[20/11/20, 10:37:12 am] Sneha RMIT: Im good at drawing
[20/11/20, 10:37:28 am] Sneha RMIT: What do you need
[20/11/20, 11:37:57 am] Jacob: Oh yeah you are! We were just thinking of storyboard for the game
[20/11/20, 11:39:11 am] Jacob: Have you guys enrolled in subjects for next study period?
[20/11/20, 3:26:48 pm] Jacob: I did a quick profile section, it's mostly recycled from assignment 2
[20/11/20, 3:38:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great stuff
[20/11/20, 3:52:16 pm] Jacob: im making a skeleton in the draft document and the yellow bits are where we need to write stuff
[20/11/20, 4:24:18 pm] Jacob: before i go to far, has anybody already made as start or written anything for any sections?
[20/11/20, 4:24:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nothing from my end
[20/11/20, 4:25:46 pm] Jacob: ok cool 👍
[20/11/20, 4:26:30 pm] Jacob: if anybody wants to jump in and write anything, or even just dot points would be great
[20/11/20, 4:26:39 pm] Jacob: lets scrape up some marks haha
[20/11/20, 4:28:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to sit later tonight 😊
[20/11/20, 4:30:27 pm] Jacob: awesome
[20/11/20, 6:16:56 pm] Jacob: i did the overview section too, based on the A2
[20/11/20, 7:37:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good eve all. I’m home now
[20/11/20, 7:37:27 pm] Jacob: ok i did the aims section, please anybody feel free to change or question what i have done, i'm really just making stuff up
[20/11/20, 7:37:47 pm] Jacob: hi raj
[20/11/20, 7:37:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Great work, Jacob.
[20/11/20, 7:38:08 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll start work on our A3 from tomorrow

[20/11/20, 7:46:06 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sure Jac 🤣
[21/11/20, 12:11:28 am] Jacob: has anybody had a look at A5 too? its worth 20% and due on the same day
[21/11/20, 12:12:25 am] Rajaneesh Nair: It’s about making a video , isn’t it, Jacob?
[21/11/20, 12:12:42 am] Jacob: yeah that's right
[21/11/20, 12:13:17 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I think we need to add A5 also with with A3 to do list
[21/11/20, 12:13:40 am] Jacob: yes, good idea
[21/11/20, 12:14:42 am] Jacob: we just need 50% of everything and we can pass!
[21/11/20, 12:27:59 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Assignment 1 +2 + 4 = 40 marks
[21/11/20, 12:28:44 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 3+5 = 50 marks
[21/11/20, 12:29:00 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Exam 10 marks
[21/11/20, 12:30:48 am] Jacob: so we need to get like 30% for A3 and A5
[21/11/20, 12:31:11 am] Jacob: i didnt know there was an exam!
[21/11/20, 12:31:46 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Oops, I think there is no exam
[21/11/20, 12:31:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Exam is for programming
[21/11/20, 12:32:00 am] Jacob: phew!
[21/11/20, 12:32:33 am] Rajaneesh Nair: This is it
[21/11/20, 12:33:12 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Omg, A3 got 40% !
[21/11/20, 12:33:12 am] Jacob: https://www.calculatorgenius.com/grade-calculators/weighted-grade-calculator/
[21/11/20, 12:33:27 am] Jacob: yes!!
[21/11/20, 12:34:17 am] Jacob: check out that calculator, you can put in the percent that each one is worth and see what we need to get
[21/11/20, 12:35:15 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Did you submitted A4, Jacob?
[21/11/20, 12:35:28 am] Jacob: no, i'm working on it now
[21/11/20, 12:35:47 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Okey. Great 👍🏻🤝
[21/11/20, 12:35:51 am] Sneha RMIT: i am working on A4 now as well
[21/11/20, 12:35:59 am] Sneha RMIT: all nighter for me
[21/11/20, 12:36:00 am] Jacob: i still need to to make a submission post for weeks 4-6
[21/11/20, 12:36:16 am] Sneha RMIT: who's going to be speaking on the video
[21/11/20, 12:36:43 am] Jacob: i think jordan is a really good presenter and confident
[21/11/20, 12:36:52 am] Jacob: if he is willing
[21/11/20, 12:37:01 am] Sneha RMIT: i dont somewhat get how you reflect on already reflected activities
[21/11/20, 12:37:05 am] Jacob: i watched his powerpoint video in the modules and it was excellent
[21/11/20, 12:37:14 am] Sneha RMIT: some of these assessments are somewhat a double up
[21/11/20, 12:37:16 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I could do that but I assure you you all will fail then 😀
[21/11/20, 12:37:33 am] Sneha RMIT: hahha how are you feeling raj
[21/11/20, 12:37:47 am] Jacob: if we just do everything we surely cant fail!
[21/11/20, 12:38:06 am] Sneha RMIT: no one will fail
[21/11/20, 12:38:13 am] Sneha RMIT: dont stress so much
[21/11/20, 12:38:25 am] Jacob: haha yep, thanks sneha
[21/11/20, 12:38:28 am] Sneha RMIT: positive affirmations create positive outcomes :P
[21/11/20, 12:38:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes Jacob.🙏🏼🙏🏼😃
[21/11/20, 12:38:49 am] Sneha RMIT: so... we are going to do fantastic
[21/11/20, 12:38:54 am] Sneha RMIT: hint hint :)
[21/11/20, 12:39:04 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m feeling better , Sneha . Thx
[21/11/20, 12:39:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[21/11/20, 12:39:10 am] Jacob: we are doing well!
[21/11/20, 12:39:28 am] Jacob: we have done really well so far
[21/11/20, 12:39:33 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes, Jacob we will get 90% for sure
[21/11/20, 12:41:19 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob- I’m still struggling with Storyboard
[21/11/20, 12:41:37 am] Sneha RMIT: what's storyboard
[21/11/20, 12:41:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: For our A3 project
[21/11/20, 12:42:23 am] Jacob: wasnt ben working on something with unreal engine?
[21/11/20, 12:42:50 am] Sneha RMIT: ok what's unreal engine
[21/11/20, 12:42:57 am] Sneha RMIT: i think i missed something
[21/11/20, 12:43:33 am] Jacob: yeah thats all to do with the tangible artifacts
[21/11/20, 12:43:57 am] Jacob: so we need to actually produce something, or take steps towards producing something
[21/11/20, 12:44:13 am] Jacob: not just the report
[21/11/20, 12:44:33 am] Jacob: significant percentage of the grade is for 'tangible artifacts'
[21/11/20, 12:44:51 am] Jacob: and ben's idea for his project involved using unreal engine
[21/11/20, 12:45:12 am] Jacob: which is as far as i can gather like a 3d game developing tool
[21/11/20, 12:45:46 am] Jacob: so i thought he was working on something, like just a scene or something
[21/11/20, 12:46:15 am] Jacob: the storyboard is just another idea for a tangible artifact
[21/11/20, 12:48:43 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, i was just joking , imagine if I do the video presentation 😃
[21/11/20, 12:48:54 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry 😞
[21/11/20, 12:50:38 am] Jacob: oh you mean a storyboard for the video presentation?
[21/11/20, 12:50:59 am] Jacob: i thought we were talking about a storyboard for a scene of the game!
[21/11/20, 12:51:00 am] Jacob: sorry raj
[21/11/20, 12:51:24 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Na- A5 video presentation 🙂
[21/11/20, 12:51:35 am] Jacob: i do think you would do a good presentation though
[21/11/20, 12:51:45 am] Jacob: 😀
[21/11/20, 12:51:58 am] Rajaneesh Nair: How sweet of you . Thank you so much
[21/11/20, 12:51:59 am] Jacob: maybe not just after getting out of hospital
[21/11/20, 12:53:13 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Fingers crossed - we all will pass get distinction
[21/11/20, 12:53:37 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good night , Jacob and Sneha.
[21/11/20, 12:53:45 am] Jacob: 🤞
[21/11/20, 12:54:05 am] Jacob: yep, goodnight, rest well and get better!
[21/11/20, 12:54:37 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you 🙏🏼
[21/11/20, 2:14:46 am] Sneha RMIT: hey did you guys do something similar
‎[21/11/20, 2:14:56 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[21/11/20, 9:28:20 am] Jacob: I think that’s great sneha, there’s not really many guidelines on the assignment, so I think it’s just how they can see if we were active or not...so I guess it’s what they want! I think the only thing is to make sure we include something and describe how our opinion has changed on it
[21/11/20, 9:29:13 am] Jacob: I haven’t written mine yet but that’s pretty much how I am planning to do it
[21/11/20, 9:33:22 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Superb work, Sneha
[21/11/20, 10:04:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Do we need to use Github for A4?
[21/11/20, 10:04:33 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning
[21/11/20, 10:04:41 am] Sneha RMIT: No i dont think so
[21/11/20, 10:04:52 am] Sneha RMIT: I think you need to submit a pdf
[21/11/20, 10:05:50 am] Sneha RMIT: Great thanks 😊
[21/11/20, 10:06:54 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Morning, Sneha. Thank you for clarifying that
[21/11/20, 10:07:07 am] Sneha RMIT: All good
[21/11/20, 10:07:20 am] Sneha RMIT: I submitted at 4am ☺️
[21/11/20, 10:07:46 am] Sneha RMIT: Now got two more assessments for this subjects and a gazilion for programming
[21/11/20, 10:08:26 am] Sneha RMIT: And its my wedding anniversary tomorrow so im going to be out for the weekend
[21/11/20, 10:09:14 am] Rajaneesh Nair: WOW.. anniversary wishes and prayers ..💐💐
[21/11/20, 10:09:28 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊

[21/11/20, 10:46:18 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: the game will show the story of king and body gaurd
[21/11/20, 10:47:49 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[21/11/20, 10:49:30 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all, kindly let me know if the story board is  okey.

*Game level one*

The Demon ask question to the heroine. 
•	Heroine will lose one life if she fails to give right answer
•	Heroine will get 100 points and will move to next level if she give right answer

*Question*
Short Summary: Sam with his mighty physical strength gains the position of being bodyguard to King George. But he charges him a hefty sum of 9 gold coins daily. One day the goddess of tells Sam that a demon who sleeps in a cave will soon wake up and eat the king to satisfy his hunger. Being king's bodyguard, Sam along with his family decides to sacrifice their lives and hence enter the cave. After knowing what Sam did to save his life, King George feels ashamed of not doing his duty of protecting his masses and he too enters the cave. The goddess of wealth comes and tells them all of how it was all her plan to test Sam if he really was loyal as he charged a huge amount.
Question: The Demon asks heroine - Between King George and Sam whose sacrifice is greater?

*Answer*: the heroine answers - It was Sam's duty to protect the king and he did duty by protecting King George, whereas King George had no such obligation towards Sam. Hence King George's sacrifice was greater.
[22/11/20, 12:10:20 am] Jacob: Its good Raj, but I think we need to collaborate with Ben on this one, what I already wrote in the draft file was more like everyday life. I’m happy to adapt to anything though as long as we are writing about the same thing
[22/11/20, 12:12:23 am] Jacob: When can everybody have a meeting?
[22/11/20, 6:56:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Got it , Jacob 👍🏻
[22/11/20, 7:04:44 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Can we meet  12 pm or 6 pm today?
[22/11/20, 7:49:15 am] Rajaneesh Nair: *Question*
If you only share your dark moments, people won’t be convinced that you can help them! If the point of sharing the darkness is to empathize with your audience, then the point of sharing the turning point is to show them what it looked like when you stopped falling and started climbing.

*Consider the following:*

When was it that you decided to do something differently / take a new direction in your life or work?

Or 
When were some times that you took a different direction than originally planned? (i.e., things didn’t go as you thought and it ended up being for the better?)
[22/11/20, 7:52:04 am] Rajaneesh Nair: What you think , similar  kind of questions are okay for our project?
[22/11/20, 10:37:01 am] Jacob: I can meet at 6 today Raj, hopefully the others can too 👍
[22/11/20, 10:45:19 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻
[22/11/20, 12:04:11 pm] Ben: Sorry I've been very away again everyone, everything has been rather insane for me too. 
Are you two available a tiny bit earlier? I'm starting work at 6:00pm this evening, so would we be able to push it to more like 5? If not, it's alright. I'll spend a bit of time writing out my plot ideas and gameplay mechanics shortly, and will post them to go through. That being said, please feel free to alter as you want, this is no longer just my idea, but ours :)
[22/11/20, 1:44:53 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[22/11/20, 12:16:05 pm] Jacob: Thanks Ben! 5 should be okay for me. If it’s not okay for everybody could you please have a look at what I wrote in the draft file on teams for the overview and goals and see if it’s okay and also raj’s storyboard work and see if we can work from it? I know it’s our project but I think your idea is awesome and if we have your vision to work from it will make it easier for us to all be consistent
[22/11/20, 12:16:45 pm] Ben: I'll jump in and have a look now
[22/11/20, 12:17:01 pm] Jacob: Awesome 👍
[22/11/20, 1:46:18 pm] Ben: Brilliant!

I have unfortunately had to withdraw from the course.
A lot going on personally and with work where I can't have any time to catch up and help out.
Sorry for the late notice and sorry for the trouble.
Thanks for being a great team and I'll be sure to use what I've learned working you guys when I redo the subject in few months.

[23/11/20, 9:44:57 am] Jacob: Hi Sneha, that's a good idea, it can't hurt to try, especially now that we have lost Jordan
[23/11/20, 9:46:10 am] Jacob: Thankyou Raj, i'm watching it's really helpful
[23/11/20, 10:06:04 am] Jacob: @61437563574  Hey ben, glad you liked my recycling of A2 😀
[23/11/20, 10:08:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks raj. Yes i did
[23/11/20, 10:09:19 am] Sneha RMIT: Yes probably should let Anthony know that we’ve lost jordan
[23/11/20, 10:23:25 am] Sneha RMIT: Hey guys btw when does the next set of subjects start
[23/11/20, 10:23:38 am] Sneha RMIT: I just got a notification on my email
[23/11/20, 10:24:39 am] Jacob: My ones start on the 30th, but I think they can vary
[23/11/20, 10:25:01 am] Sneha RMIT: Far out
[23/11/20, 10:25:06 am] Sneha RMIT: No breather at all
[23/11/20, 10:25:15 am] Sneha RMIT: Which ones are you doing
[23/11/20, 10:25:18 am] Jacob: Yeah it’s not very nice!
[23/11/20, 10:25:22 am] Sneha RMIT: Haha
‎[23/11/20, 10:28:02 am] Jacob: ‎image omitted
[23/11/20, 10:28:50 am] Jacob: I just chose one core and then the other 2 are electives from different unis to try to make it a bit easier, but I will end up dropping the one that I don’t want
[23/11/20, 10:29:15 am] Sneha RMIT: Oh cool
[23/11/20, 10:29:20 am] Sneha RMIT: You can do that
[23/11/20, 10:29:31 am] Sneha RMIT: Do you need to get special permission or anything
[23/11/20, 10:29:34 am] Jacob: Yeah it’s great, you can choose anything you like!
[23/11/20, 10:29:54 am] Jacob: I don’t think so, I think you can choose any electives
[23/11/20, 10:29:56 am] Sneha RMIT: Im doing intro to computer systems too i think
[23/11/20, 10:30:02 am] Jacob: But don’t quote me on that
[23/11/20, 10:30:06 am] Sneha RMIT: But how are you going to manage 3 subjects
[23/11/20, 10:30:32 am] Sneha RMIT: Unless the amount of work is less on the other subjects from other uni’s
[23/11/20, 10:32:07 am] Murray: Hey guys so sorry. I’m on call at work the last week and just happened to be one of the busiest weeks of the year lol. 

I finally have some time today (hopefully if I don’t get a call) to look into what we up to.

How much do we have to go on this? Sorry for the dumb question :(
[23/11/20, 10:32:28 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning muz
[23/11/20, 10:32:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Morning Muz 😇
[23/11/20, 10:33:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea same here. Today going to focus on uni. Working from home today so ☺️😅
[23/11/20, 10:33:11 am] Jacob: Hey muz!
[23/11/20, 10:33:58 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Too much things we need to do 😞
[23/11/20, 10:34:01 am] Jacob: Just have a look at Raj and bens meeting recording from yesterday and check out the a3 draft file on teams
[23/11/20, 10:34:18 am] Rajaneesh Nair: But we will finish it on time
[23/11/20, 10:35:08 am] Jacob: Also check out raj’s picture that he made
[23/11/20, 10:35:30 am] Jacob: Just jump into the draft and add anything that is yellow
[23/11/20, 10:35:37 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jacob. I glad you like my picture 😇
[23/11/20, 10:35:58 am] Murray: Okie dokie I’ll have a look. It’s due 26/11 right?
[23/11/20, 10:36:04 am] Jacob: I’ve been taking from a2 and fleshing it out, adding and editing to make sure it meets the requirements
[23/11/20, 10:36:14 am] Jacob: Yeah I think so
[23/11/20, 10:36:37 am] Sneha RMIT: Who’s focusing on the video presentation
[23/11/20, 10:36:58 am] Sneha RMIT: And who’s going to do the presenting
[23/11/20, 10:37:28 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Ben said he’s happy to do the presentation if we make the script
[23/11/20, 10:37:41 am] Jacob: I don’t think I’ll be able to manage 3, but I’ll just start them and see which one I like the best/is more manageable and drop one of the electives before census date to leave me with 2
[23/11/20, 10:37:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Should i make a draft script
[23/11/20, 10:37:59 am] Jacob: Ben is an awesome talker
[23/11/20, 10:38:16 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok fantastic 😊

[23/11/20, 10:40:06 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, you are so talented in documentation and you are a great organiser too
[23/11/20, 10:40:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: My English is so horrible- I’m not able to speak 🙁
[23/11/20, 10:42:06 am] Jacob: Well most people I know can only speak one language, so you’re doing pretty well I think!
[23/11/20, 10:42:15 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok guys just confirm should i work on the script for the presentation
[23/11/20, 10:42:22 am] Sneha RMIT: I can try to get that done today
[23/11/20, 10:42:45 am] Rajaneesh Nair: That’s awesome, Sneha
[23/11/20, 10:42:55 am] Sneha RMIT: Cool
[23/11/20, 10:43:09 am] Jacob: Yeah that’s fantastic!
[23/11/20, 10:43:19 am] Sneha RMIT: Once i get that done, if someone could get that checked so that we have one assessment ready
[23/11/20, 10:43:36 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m working on A3 pending work. Will try my best to finish it today itself
[23/11/20, 10:43:49 am] Sneha RMIT: Great stuff
[23/11/20, 10:43:55 am] Jacob: Which sections Raj?
[23/11/20, 10:44:01 am] Jacob: Oh sorry
[23/11/20, 10:44:53 am] Jacob: Wait, sorry which bit of a3? Just so I don’t double up
[23/11/20, 10:45:05 am] Sneha RMIT: Exactly
[23/11/20, 10:45:26 am] Sneha RMIT: I was scratching my head for a sec
[23/11/20, 10:45:39 am] Sneha RMIT: Lets say presentation work or website work
[23/11/20, 10:47:35 am] Rajaneesh Nair: A3 -

[23/11/20, 10:50:43 am] Sneha RMIT: I tend to stuff up on that
[23/11/20, 10:50:58 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok fantastic
[23/11/20, 10:51:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m doing  some of Jordon’s work
[23/11/20, 10:51:29 am] Sneha RMIT: For the time being guys. Im focusing on the script for the presentation
[23/11/20, 10:51:33 am] Jacob: I can try sneha, I already made the GitHub for us and tested it with a index file, so hopefully we won’t have those issues again
[23/11/20, 10:51:54 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok fantastic we’ll do this together
[23/11/20, 10:52:49 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll do my best to provide materials. Jacob , kindly assist me to correct grammar and all

[23/11/20, 3:18:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hahah
[23/11/20, 3:19:10 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[23/11/20, 3:20:03 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Are you going to add ‘read file /write file stuff on A3 programming?
[23/11/20, 3:42:53 pm] Jacob: i normally really struggle with the iie's until i watch the lecture later
[23/11/20, 3:43:42 pm] Jacob: luckily we still get marks if try before its due
[23/11/20, 6:19:13 pm] Murray: Hey guys, So I was having a read through the draft and added a little bit on the testing. I am going to do the Tools and Technology part as well and try flesh it out. I will go through and see what else I can do.

Is anyone working on something at the moment? I don't want to step on any toes and double up on sections.
[23/11/20, 6:26:43 pm] Jacob: Go for it I reckon muz. 👍
[23/11/20, 6:27:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Go for it muz ✨
[23/11/20, 6:28:40 pm] Murray: 👍
[23/11/20, 6:29:30 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Muz. I’m doing Jordan’s work -*Risk*
[23/11/20, 6:37:43 pm] Jacob: is anybody doing skills and jobs?
[23/11/20, 6:38:38 pm] Jacob: there's a reference list at the bottom btw, so we can keep it all consistent
[23/11/20, 6:39:59 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jacob, I don’t think anyone doing that
[23/11/20, 6:40:14 pm] Jacob: aweosme im on it then
[23/11/20, 6:40:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: You are a rock star ⭐️
[23/11/20, 6:47:54 pm] Jacob: i can do roles too if nobody is already as it links pretty well to skills and jobs
[23/11/20, 10:14:30 pm] Jacob: skills and jobs bit is done! but perhaps could be better if anybody has a better idea of what skills are needed for the jobs i made up, please feel free to edit
[23/11/20, 10:35:07 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[24/11/20, 9:22:05 am] Jacob: Hi everyone, how’s it going? Will we be on track to finish on Friday you think? I’m working for the next three days but will have evenings and all day Friday to do it too
[24/11/20, 10:46:15 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning
[24/11/20, 10:46:26 am] Sneha RMIT: Not sure to be honest
[24/11/20, 10:46:30 am] Sneha RMIT: A bit lost
[24/11/20, 10:46:56 am] Sneha RMIT: Tried to work on the script for the presentation last night but was a bit lost
[24/11/20, 10:47:06 am] Sneha RMIT: Need some guidance from you guys
[24/11/20, 11:04:52 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll update you guys in the evening with where im at with everything

[24/11/20, 11:22:11 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m going to sit down and start uni work in 15mins
[24/11/20, 11:22:25 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Awesome
[24/11/20, 11:22:33 am] Sneha RMIT: Might need to bug to get clarification on some things
[24/11/20, 11:22:54 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yellow parts are slowly disappearing from our draft
[24/11/20, 11:23:12 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok great
[24/11/20, 11:23:21 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Might need need a mug of beer to cool my head 😃
[24/11/20, 11:23:35 am] Sneha RMIT: Ive come down with the flu
[24/11/20, 11:23:49 am] Sneha RMIT: And stressing big time about programming
[24/11/20, 11:24:24 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh god 😔 pls have some rest
[24/11/20, 11:24:42 am] Rajaneesh Nair: You can resume work after lunch
[24/11/20, 11:25:04 am] Rajaneesh Nair: A power nap will really help
[24/11/20, 11:25:19 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea just planning to do that. Lol wish i could do magic and make my kids disappear for a day or two
[24/11/20, 11:25:33 am] Sneha RMIT: 🤦‍♀️ im such a bad parent for saying that
[24/11/20, 11:26:40 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Ha ha . Na . This is what my wife and I always say while we stirring each other in the middle of work
[24/11/20, 11:26:51 am] Sneha RMIT: Hahha
[24/11/20, 11:27:17 am] Sneha RMIT: Harder than the actual work is dealing or being interrupted after every 5mins
[24/11/20, 11:27:33 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 😀
[24/11/20, 11:28:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: You know what , I am doing only one subject on next semester. I’m planning to do some practice in java
[24/11/20, 11:28:22 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 😖
[24/11/20, 11:28:39 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I realise how dumb I’m 😀
[24/11/20, 12:29:11 pm] Jacob: Shall we have a meeting tonight and shall we ask for extension before it’s too late? What do you guys think. Sorry I’m at work and can’t really talk much now
[24/11/20, 12:31:58 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes,  certainly, JacobI’m free after 4.30 onwards.
[24/11/20, 12:33:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup will be home from picking the kids 6pm
[24/11/20, 12:34:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: I found a tutor. But he’s charging a whooping $55 per hour
[24/11/20, 12:34:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Today is the first session
[24/11/20, 12:34:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll let you know if its worth it

[24/11/20, 12:50:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Now this is probably the reason why jordan had a hard time
[24/11/20, 12:50:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: The everyday story in my house
[24/11/20, 12:51:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Aside from work and uni.. the biggest nightmare is when toddlers become mosters and go absolutely bizurk and throw everything
[24/11/20, 1:02:50 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good luck , Sneha. Kindly let me know 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[24/11/20, 1:03:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: So , we can do a meeting around 6.30 or 7.00
‎[24/11/20, 1:04:40 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted
[24/11/20, 1:04:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂
[24/11/20, 1:05:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup 6.30 or 7pm works for me
[24/11/20, 4:26:54 pm] Jacob: 6.30/7.00 works for me too
[24/11/20, 4:59:02 pm] Jacob: Hey Sneha, Ben said in the meeting that he could probably quite easily talk about the project for 5 minutes, so maybe we could work backwards and make a script/storyboard based on what he said? just a thought because i wouldn't know wat to say either!
[24/11/20, 4:59:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea that sounds good
[24/11/20, 4:59:47 pm] Jacob: nice one raj! i didnt change too much
[24/11/20, 4:59:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Actually that would be brilliant as I wouldn’t be second guessing the pitch
[24/11/20, 5:00:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks champ!
[24/11/20, 5:00:11 pm] Jacob: yeah true haha
[24/11/20, 5:00:18 pm] Jacob: as long as ben is still happy to do that!
[24/11/20, 5:00:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Going to miss this team next term
[24/11/20, 5:00:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Absolutely
[24/11/20, 5:00:53 pm] Jacob: has any body chosen computer systems for next term?
[24/11/20, 5:01:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup me
[24/11/20, 5:01:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: I somewhat feel it will be easier
[24/11/20, 5:03:16 pm] Jacob: oh nice! i hope it is a bit easier now that we have these courses done...
[24/11/20, 5:03:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yes so true
[24/11/20, 5:03:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: You know quite a few students were upset with gayan
[24/11/20, 5:03:54 pm] Jacob: in last nights lecture?
[24/11/20, 5:03:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Some wrote quite a bit on the discussion board
[24/11/20, 5:04:08 pm] Jacob: oh i didnt see
[24/11/20, 5:04:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Well he said to communicate on the discussion board but then wrote comments saying email me directly
[24/11/20, 5:04:36 pm] Jacob: im going to have a look
[24/11/20, 5:04:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: So couple of students got upset that they were getting marked down a far bit
[24/11/20, 5:05:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Assignment 2 was marked quite tough
[24/11/20, 5:05:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: I did crap 💩
[24/11/20, 5:05:42 pm] Jacob: oh no!
[24/11/20, 5:05:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: I got 7 out of 15
[24/11/20, 5:06:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😭
[24/11/20, 5:06:11 pm] Jacob: i did well, but a3 could be different, i havent started yet
[24/11/20, 5:06:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok im so bugging you now jake
[24/11/20, 5:06:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😂
[24/11/20, 5:07:16 pm] Jacob: haha feel free, ill be happy to help if i can, but i really dont feel like i understand the concepts, i just followed the tutorials
[24/11/20, 5:07:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: As long as i can pass this subject im happy
[24/11/20, 5:08:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea i did that and thought i was doing ok but somewhere in week 8 i lost sight
[24/11/20, 5:08:53 pm] Jacob: yeah it got really hard then i think
[24/11/20, 5:09:07 pm] Jacob: 8 and 9
[24/11/20, 5:10:19 pm] Jacob: for the assignment i honestly just adapted my IIE, so hopefuly that will work again!
[24/11/20, 5:10:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea i think you’ll do great
[24/11/20, 5:12:35 pm] Jacob: the adelaide lockdown was really great for catching up😛
[24/11/20, 5:20:05 pm] Jacob: is anybody working on any sections at the moment or can i choose any?
[24/11/20, 5:26:28 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jacob- I’m doing TimeFram- I’ll update it tonight.
[24/11/20, 5:26:45 pm] Jacob: awesome
[24/11/20, 5:31:05 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m doing that , Jacob but Withdrawn User- Cantered design 😔 I got 14 marks in A2 programming but still struggling... I  think I need time  to practice Java before moving further
[24/11/20, 5:32:29 pm] Jacob: yeah i agree raj, i would almost like to do the intro to programming again to understand java properly
[24/11/20, 5:50:14 pm] Jacob: What time are we meeting tonight?
[24/11/20, 5:52:10 pm] Murray: Hey guys I have a work call tonight starting soon. A customer escalated something to our managing director so it’s all blowing up right now haha.

If it goes well hopefully I can still join a call tonight.
[24/11/20, 5:52:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im just picking up the kids now so should be fine for 6.30 or 7
[24/11/20, 5:55:06 pm] Jacob: no worries muz, let's see how we go then
[24/11/20, 5:56:13 pm] Jacob: ben can you join?
[24/11/20, 6:19:21 pm] Jacob: group processes and communications is done
[24/11/20, 6:19:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Champion
[24/11/20, 6:39:48 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all , Scheduled  a team meeting @ 7.00 pm today . Cya
[24/11/20, 6:41:42 pm] Jacob: 👍
[24/11/20, 6:41:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: 🙌
[24/11/20, 6:42:13 pm] Jacob: i did a real quick scope and limits section too
[24/11/20, 9:55:00 pm] Jacob: hey does anybody have a copy of the evidence pdf that jordan made for a2 so we can copy it for a3?
[24/11/20, 10:29:15 pm] Murray: My work thing is still ongoing haha. How did the meeting go guys?
[24/11/20, 10:34:49 pm] Jacob: it went well muz, raj recorded it, we have a plan: ben is going to do the 5 minute presentation, sneha is going to do the transfer to webpage, raj and me were going to finish writing the report. we are going to try to have it pretty much done by tomorrow so we can work on finalising it for friday. and meet again tomorrow same time. If you have time to help write some of the big section - plans and progress - it would be awesome, or even if you have any thoughts or ideas just chuck some dot points down
[24/11/20, 11:35:25 pm] Jacob: hey raj, im writing a bit for the plans and progress, which is like the story of the picture that you drew and the detailed description of the game
‎[25/11/20, 12:20:58 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted
[25/11/20, 12:21:05 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Superb, Jacob
[25/11/20, 12:21:37 am] Jacob: all the bits are starting to match to each other now!
[25/11/20, 12:22:18 am] Jacob: plans and progress still needs a lot more work and i have no idea how to do the timeframe yet
[25/11/20, 12:22:37 am] Jacob: but apart from that its really just feedback
[25/11/20, 12:27:49 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob , I’m writing about planning, pre-production, production, testing, launch and post-production of this project. I think it will be 1000 plus words
[25/11/20, 12:28:38 am] Jacob: Fantastic that’s should be all we need to finish then!
[25/11/20, 12:28:42 am] Jacob: Great job
[25/11/20, 12:29:21 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I think I can finish this part by afternoon. I’ll jumb on time fram then
[25/11/20, 12:30:08 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you for make the skeleton of the  A3 , Jacob . It’s really helps me to understand and organise the things
[25/11/20, 12:30:14 am] Rajaneesh Nair: You are awesome
[25/11/20, 12:30:48 am] Jacob: No worries, it’s the only way I could make sense of it too
[25/11/20, 12:31:10 am] Jacob: I didn’t know how to start this assignment for so long
[25/11/20, 12:31:56 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Tell me ! I created a file called A3 draft and I didn’t know what to add 🤩
[25/11/20, 12:33:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m going to stop writing in 10 minutes. Planning to take off from work tomorrow 😇
[25/11/20, 12:33:43 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[25/11/20, 12:34:16 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I need to put tooth pick between eye lashes otherwise 😂
[25/11/20, 12:34:18 am] Jacob: Oh that’s good idea! well I’m stopping now too, so I will start again tomorrow after work
[25/11/20, 12:34:33 am] Jacob: Haha yeah I need to as well
[25/11/20, 12:34:48 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good night and thank you so much for your help today 👍🏻🤝
[25/11/20, 12:35:11 am] Jacob: Goodnight Raj thank you too 🙏
[25/11/20, 11:24:03 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning All
[25/11/20, 11:25:19 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Jacob, I just uploaded *Plans and progress *in Team.

[25/11/20, 11:27:46 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls help to correct grammar mistakes
[25/11/20, 11:28:03 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Sneha. How’s your headache?
[25/11/20, 11:28:37 am] Sneha RMIT: Hi raj, no headache ☺️ but down with the flu very bad
[25/11/20, 11:28:54 am] Sneha RMIT: Not lucky im working from home anyway so real dramas
[25/11/20, 11:30:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh... 😟

[25/11/20, 11:32:38 am] Sneha RMIT: Haha
[25/11/20, 11:32:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Fuel is empty and I couldn’t open the lid to fill
[25/11/20, 11:32:42 am] Sneha RMIT: Why not
[25/11/20, 11:32:52 am] Sneha RMIT: Oh god 🤦‍♀️🤣
[25/11/20, 11:32:59 am] Sneha RMIT: That’s horrible
[25/11/20, 11:33:07 am] Sneha RMIT: Is there someone who can help you out
[25/11/20, 11:33:39 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes. I got an appointment with car GP today @ 1.00 . He’ll fix it
[25/11/20, 11:33:56 am] Sneha RMIT: Good luck with that
[25/11/20, 11:34:51 am] Sneha RMIT: I on the other hand had a bit of a go at gayan on the discussion board today. Dont know what impact that will have.. 😅😭

[25/11/20, 11:37:12 am] Rajaneesh Nair: You said it
[25/11/20, 11:37:14 am] Rajaneesh Nair: !
[25/11/20, 11:37:21 am] Sneha RMIT: Luckily its not for this group assignment 🤦‍♀️😅
[25/11/20, 11:37:26 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Exactly correct
[25/11/20, 11:37:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I gave them course feed back 1 out of10
[25/11/20, 11:38:18 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I used some nasty words
[25/11/20, 11:38:41 am] Sneha RMIT: I mean I exhausted videos, linkedin learning and have spoken to several tutors now and they said because of GTerm being inconsistent with java it makes it hard
[25/11/20, 11:38:46 am] Rajaneesh Nair: My situation is exactly same as yours.
[25/11/20, 11:38:49 am] Sneha RMIT: Hahha
[25/11/20, 11:39:18 am] Sneha RMIT: Being that it is first semester, several students have freaked out and just quit
[25/11/20, 11:39:40 am] Sneha RMIT: I lost marks on things like using JOption
[25/11/20, 11:40:07 am] Sneha RMIT: So ideally its not that it was wrong but that they didn’t want it used
[25/11/20, 11:40:22 am] Rajaneesh Nair: The problem is 6 lectures styles  including Gayan’s are entirely different from each other’s . I alsways confuse which one I need to watch and follow
[25/11/20, 11:41:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Absolutely spot on. Gayan, geela, srikanth the three that i have had direct contact with all say different things
[25/11/20, 11:41:30 am] Sneha RMIT: And we aren’t exactly in a class so it makes it even harder to actually fundamentally learn one consistent method
[25/11/20, 11:42:31 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I used to watch whole 5 videos and could digest only 5%
[25/11/20, 11:42:43 am] Sneha RMIT: Which is why those students who are advanced as well some were scratching their head not because they didn’t know how to programme but rather that they didn’t know who’s method to follow
[25/11/20, 11:42:43 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Then I watch YouTube
[25/11/20, 11:42:56 am] Sneha RMIT: Yup did the same
[25/11/20, 11:43:00 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Exactly
[25/11/20, 11:43:22 am] Sneha RMIT: Watching Youtube and learning was easier than paying for a degree 🤦‍♀️🤣
[25/11/20, 11:43:26 am] Sneha RMIT: Sounds so bad
[25/11/20, 11:44:06 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Many of students dropped this course bcoz this unorganised structure
[25/11/20, 11:44:29 am] Sneha RMIT: Remember the tutor i got yesterday.. he charged $55 per hour (discounted) and he was like why are they teaching you guys like this
[25/11/20, 11:45:03 am] Sneha RMIT: First thing he told me to do is avoid using eclipse
[25/11/20, 11:45:16 am] Sneha RMIT: It makes it harder to track the code changes
[25/11/20, 11:47:07 am] Rajaneesh Nair: That’s great , Sneha
[25/11/20, 11:47:32 am] Sneha RMIT: Look at the end of the day i’m sure most of will pass.. but crux of the story is that it defeats the purpose of really learning java properly
[25/11/20, 11:51:01 am] Rajaneesh Nair: You said it . I’m so dissatisfied and disappointed with RMIT java intro. I bought this book too
‎[25/11/20, 11:51:05 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[25/11/20, 11:51:41 am] Sneha RMIT: Hahha me too. Did it help?
[25/11/20, 11:53:17 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes. It looks nice need two brain to understand 😖
[25/11/20, 11:57:46 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Which one you are using now ,Sneha
[25/11/20, 11:59:09 am] Sneha RMIT: IntelliJ
[25/11/20, 12:00:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: So much easier to change code on this. You for example highlight one variable and replace and it consistency will make the changes everywhere needed
[25/11/20, 12:16:20 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Wow..
[25/11/20, 12:17:10 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: That’s what we need . Guyan teaches in hard ways
[25/11/20, 12:23:14 pm] Jacob: Coo I’ll check it out after work Raj 👍
[25/11/20, 12:31:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sure , Jacob . Thank you so much . There are 1254 words including yours and my work
[25/11/20, 12:31:44 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: It’s all most two pages
[25/11/20, 12:32:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Kindly let me know if you want me to add more words
[25/11/20, 3:58:25 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Dear Muz , unfortunately I couldn’t understand how to do timeframe part . Really appreciated if you try
[25/11/20, 3:58:50 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 😟
[25/11/20, 4:18:33 pm] Jacob: excellent work with the plans and progress Raj!
[25/11/20, 4:18:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great stuff.
[25/11/20, 4:19:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im working on the website now
[25/11/20, 4:19:43 pm] Jacob: awesome sneha, how's it going?
[25/11/20, 4:19:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its coming along...
[25/11/20, 4:20:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Slowed down a bit because i’m quite ill but it should all be ready soon
[25/11/20, 4:21:02 pm] Jacob: i can start doing it too if you like
[25/11/20, 4:21:14 pm] Jacob: sorry that you're unwell!
[25/11/20, 4:21:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Na got it under control
[25/11/20, 4:22:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: There may be issues like last time though with pushing it through on github
[25/11/20, 4:22:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Will need your help possible at that point
[25/11/20, 4:22:33 pm] Jacob: ok, should we do a test early on?
[25/11/20, 4:23:12 pm] Jacob: the github pages is up and running already
[25/11/20, 4:23:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cool I’ll try in a bit
[25/11/20, 4:24:16 pm] Jacob: awesome, let me know if you need help
[25/11/20, 4:24:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[25/11/20, 4:45:25 pm] Jacob: Raj, I think we have done a great job with this section and i think we have enough words and have answered most of the questions. 👍 I left some questions from the assignment sheet in yellow that we could try to answer if we have time and want to get more points, but probably should be alright as it is
[25/11/20, 4:46:46 pm] Jacob: i got the text book too but it arrived half way through the course and now when i open it it just looks like Egyptian hieroglyphs
[25/11/20, 4:48:24 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 😂
[25/11/20, 6:10:27 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all, scheduled a meeting in Team at 7.00 pm today . 🙂
[25/11/20, 6:15:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys im stuck on a conference call. I’ll be in the meetings but might not be able to say much
[25/11/20, 6:21:19 pm] Jacob: Cool see you then
[25/11/20, 6:30:29 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha, do you want me to reschedule around 7.30 or 8.00 ?
[25/11/20, 6:31:09 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Im ok with any time today
[25/11/20, 6:38:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya either is fine
[25/11/20, 6:38:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im all 😌 good
[25/11/20, 6:42:44 pm] Jacob: hey raj, if you dont mind, can i change your work just a little bit to match the 'scope' section? our scope is to just produce one level or chapter of the game to present to investors, so dont need to build the whole game with this project
[25/11/20, 6:45:30 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls go ahead  Jacob 🙏🏼🙏🏼
[25/11/20, 6:46:22 pm] Jacob: cool thanks rajj
[25/11/20, 6:47:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, Muz, Sneha and Ben , today’s meeting is postponed from 7.pm to 7.30

[25/11/20, 8:35:59 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good news - Jordon said he will send to me today itself after finishing his work at 9.30
[25/11/20, 8:36:17 pm] Jacob: oh raj, i need to say about the referencing....the full reference should be left at the bottom like it was before in a list. and just where you used a reference, like directly after the sentence, you need to give a summarised version like this '(author, year)'
[25/11/20, 8:36:26 pm] Jacob: awesome news, thanks raj
[25/11/20, 8:37:43 pm] Jacob: here is an example:
[25/11/20, 8:37:51 pm] Jacob: The point of difference between other games of this genre, such as Dark Souls, The Last of Us and Celeste (10 Video Games That Deal With Mental Illness, 2020)
[25/11/20, 8:38:05 pm] Jacob: the bit in brackets is the in text citation

[25/11/20, 8:39:35 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I see, got it 🤝👍🏻
[25/11/20, 8:39:47 pm] Jacob: if you use citethisforme.com, it does it for you and you can click 'copy bibliography' or 'copy in text reference'
[25/11/20, 8:40:39 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻sure , Jacob
[25/11/20, 8:40:46 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jordon Says 
One thing you can do.
With the what'sapp chat. Export the chat as a text file and have that ready to go.
So up top right there's the three dots.
Press that. Go to more. And export chat.
[25/11/20, 8:42:00 pm] Jacob: oh that's good to know
[25/11/20, 10:20:32 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jordon has updates the file on teams called communication evidence template

[26/11/20, 2:03:22 am] Sneha RMIT: So what we have to remember is that we didn’t actually just lose a team member, as part of the project the business lost a employee impacting our schedule of work, delaying completion dates which could have impacted additional cost to the business
[26/11/20, 2:11:01 am] Sneha RMIT: Ive uploaded the scope section from my project management assignment. A fair bit we can use and change it to our scenario. Shouldn’t be overly difficult. Having this will be really important
[26/11/20, 3:06:20 am] Sneha RMIT: IMPORTANT:

So guys scope is like the first phase of a project. It is like the “planning” phase that involves determining and documenting the projects goals, deliverables, functions, features, tasks, deadlines and ultimately cost.

In other words this is the most important part of the entire assignment so we need to get this one right. Two things it must show-
(1) what are we trying to achieve by making this game?
(2) summary of how are we “planning” to achieve this

THIS means- that because we are only at the first stage of the game project, we are at early planning phase  which is why we only need to have done very minimal work on the actual game.
[26/11/20, 3:08:03 am] Sneha RMIT: -we need to create some diagrams 
- and copy parts from the scope document I uploaded
[26/11/20, 3:09:47 am] Sneha RMIT: Can we please have a quick chat in the morning tomorrow.
[26/11/20, 3:10:14 am] Sneha RMIT: I just realised this entire assessment is a rip of a actual project plan.
[26/11/20, 3:10:39 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ve funny enough got most of the sections we are missing
[26/11/20, 5:45:20 am] Sneha RMIT: # ive put our contribution form in word document so you guys can use a pen on word and sign. No need to print
[26/11/20, 6:13:15 am] Sneha RMIT: Last comment i swear 😅 then i’ll go to bed for a hour
# ive updated the schedule of work. Check that out please
[26/11/20, 6:14:58 am] Sneha RMIT: I still haven’t completed the website because there wasn’t much point until all the content was ready. The format of the document is ready. In fact what we finally uploaded on GitHub that version is a more clear concise version to use.
[26/11/20, 8:49:40 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning Sneha .
[26/11/20, 8:50:49 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I will finish my work at 4.30 only 😔
[26/11/20, 8:57:29 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll prepare a diagram about the entire process of project
[26/11/20, 9:02:32 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha, kindly look A3 Draft> Project and progress > Stage Five planning
[26/11/20, 9:03:20 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Do you think adding some more points will be enough? I mentioned 5 stages there
[26/11/20, 9:15:46 am] Jacob: hi guys
[26/11/20, 9:18:03 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning Jacob 🤩
[26/11/20, 9:19:24 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m in a sleepy training session now
[26/11/20, 9:21:20 am] Jacob: i thought we were almost finished and now im very confused
[26/11/20, 9:49:05 am] Jacob: How is your new job Raj?
[26/11/20, 9:56:34 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Lots of training with this job because of healthcare products
[26/11/20, 10:01:25 am] Jacob: Sounds exciting!
[26/11/20, 10:01:42 am] Jacob: What time shall we meet today? I’ll be home by about 5
[26/11/20, 10:26:07 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning guys
[26/11/20, 10:26:21 am] Sneha RMIT: Yup anytime is good
[26/11/20, 10:26:41 am] Sneha RMIT: Good luck with it all 😊
[26/11/20, 10:27:06 am] Sneha RMIT: Are you guys ok for me to go through the sections and add things
[26/11/20, 10:27:19 am] Sneha RMIT: We have it all in the file i have uploaded
[26/11/20, 10:27:30 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Your are an Angel, my friend 🙏🏼🤩
[26/11/20, 10:27:40 am] Sneha RMIT: Just needed to be changed to fit our scenario
[26/11/20, 10:27:44 am] Jacob: Morning Sneha, how are you feeling?
[26/11/20, 10:28:04 am] Jacob: Yes, feel free to change it
[26/11/20, 10:28:18 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻👍🏻
[26/11/20, 10:28:28 am] Sneha RMIT: Morning jake ☺️ antibiotics drugged but determined for us to do well 😉
[26/11/20, 10:28:39 am] Jacob: Yeah we will do well
[26/11/20, 10:29:05 am] Jacob: I know some of the sections could use more attention to get more marks
[26/11/20, 10:29:13 am] Sneha RMIT: Basically this assignment is a project management model
[26/11/20, 10:29:13 am] Rajaneesh Nair: One hour sleep is not at all good 😌
[26/11/20, 10:29:28 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Morning Jacob
[26/11/20, 10:29:36 am] Sneha RMIT: When i saw my work i was like ok.... so that’s what they meant by scope etc
[26/11/20, 10:30:08 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls go through it and give me some advices
[26/11/20, 10:30:14 am] Sneha RMIT: Meaning this. Luckily not a major headache as we’ve got it all
[26/11/20, 10:30:19 am] Jacob: I feel like some of the things you said are covered on other sections of the assignment though
[26/11/20, 10:30:37 am] Jacob: Like the aims/goals section
[26/11/20, 10:31:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea some of it is but needs to be more obvious in wording
[26/11/20, 10:31:02 am] Jacob: Yeah the scope was hard
[26/11/20, 10:31:58 am] Sneha RMIT: Like just like a essay style there are  sections which need to say “communication style” or Objective of the project etc
[26/11/20, 10:32:00 am] Jacob: Awesome well please feel free to change anything you like then
[26/11/20, 10:32:14 am] Jacob: Oh ok
[26/11/20, 10:32:24 am] Sneha RMIT: The project section is worth 50%
[26/11/20, 10:32:25 am] Jacob: Cool I’ll be able to help later after work
[26/11/20, 10:33:11 am] Sneha RMIT: Look dont stress. What i will do i go through the sections add the information and highlight it in yellow so you all can see the new added information
[26/11/20, 10:33:58 am] Jacob: Yeah no worries at all, I saw the bit you already did, it looked good
[26/11/20, 10:34:04 am] Sneha RMIT: Give a few hours. Once all of it is added it will make a lot more sense about the structural requirement
[26/11/20, 10:34:11 am] Jacob: Excellent
[26/11/20, 10:34:22 am] Sneha RMIT: 😊 great
[26/11/20, 10:34:41 am] Jacob: And then we can do the website tonight and then we are done basically
[26/11/20, 10:35:02 am] Jacob: Catch up with Ben too
[26/11/20, 10:35:29 am] Sneha RMIT: I have uploaded also our contribution form (word) doc so you all dont need to print. Just cant all go in and sign with the drawing pen and submit that once everyone’s signatures are there
[26/11/20, 10:35:38 am] Sneha RMIT: Perfect
[26/11/20, 10:35:49 am] Jacob: Oh yeah I saw but I don’t know how to get the drawing pen!
[26/11/20, 10:36:21 am] Sneha RMIT: In the word doc there should be a drawing 🖊 pen
[26/11/20, 10:36:49 am] Sneha RMIT: And you can basically just scribble away on the document
[26/11/20, 10:38:03 am] Jacob: Sorry I’m really bad with word, I can’t see it
[26/11/20, 10:39:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Give me a min
[26/11/20, 10:39:07 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll jump on the computer
[26/11/20, 10:39:30 am] Jacob: No worries, I couldn’t find it last time either that’s why Jordan did it haha
[26/11/20, 10:48:07 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok so in word
[26/11/20, 10:48:40 am] Jacob: Yep
[26/11/20, 10:49:02 am] Sneha RMIT: You need to go to:
File
Options
Customize Ribbon
And in Word Options select
Draw
[26/11/20, 10:49:25 am] Sneha RMIT: By default it would be unticked
[26/11/20, 10:49:44 am] Jacob: Is this in the ms teams version of word?
[26/11/20, 10:50:00 am] Sneha RMIT: It may not be on teams version
[26/11/20, 10:50:03 am] Sneha RMIT: I’ll check
[26/11/20, 10:50:16 am] Jacob: You’re on Mac too aren’t you?
[26/11/20, 10:50:31 am] Sneha RMIT: If not, its easy enough to use the feature on a normal word doc, cut and paste
[26/11/20, 10:50:41 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea have both and works fine
[26/11/20, 10:51:07 am] Jacob: Oh cool ok Yeah I’ll just sign a normal one then and copy it, thanks!
‎[26/11/20, 10:51:17 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 10:51:27 am] Sneha RMIT: You should see these options
[26/11/20, 10:51:47 am] Jacob: Oh weird, I’m missing draw and design
[26/11/20, 10:52:14 am] Sneha RMIT: It just must be unticked
‎[26/11/20, 10:52:35 am] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 10:53:37 am] Jacob: Awesome, got it, thanks
[26/11/20, 10:53:55 am] Sneha RMIT: ☺️🙌
[26/11/20, 2:24:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys is it ok to give the heroine of the game a name.
[26/11/20, 4:25:27 pm] Jacob: Yeah of course!
[26/11/20, 4:25:48 pm] Jacob: How’s it going? I just got home
[26/11/20, 4:25:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Good
[26/11/20, 4:26:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just left the name part highlighted in green
[26/11/20, 4:26:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Need a name 😁
[26/11/20, 4:33:11 pm] Jacob: nice work today sneha, i just had a read through😀
[26/11/20, 4:33:43 pm] Jacob: i think the name should be kind of like an every day common nae
[26/11/20, 4:33:47 pm] Jacob: name*
[26/11/20, 4:33:53 pm] Jacob: what do you think?
[26/11/20, 4:40:15 pm] Jacob: sneha can i start uploading the template website to github so we can make sure everything is running okay and work on it from there?
[26/11/20, 5:22:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey sorry got busy with work
[26/11/20, 5:22:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea sure lets get started
[26/11/20, 5:22:50 pm] Jacob: no problem
[26/11/20, 5:24:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just got to give me an hour sorry. Getting a work call coming through
[26/11/20, 5:24:44 pm] Jacob: 👍
[26/11/20, 5:27:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok so one important thing is that we have to make sure contend wise we have it all there first, as because of the formatting once it’s uploaded onto Github when you go to make changes or add images it will through off the formatt which is what the issue was last time
[26/11/20, 5:28:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: If you could jake and whoever else is ready now if you could just go into that project management example document ive uploaded and just copy n paste sections
[26/11/20, 5:29:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Once we have that, it will be as easy as just taking those sections and putting it on the HTML template that we already have
[26/11/20, 5:31:14 pm] Jacob: im not realy sure that i understand sneha, i ave the document open, but what do i need to copy and paste?
[26/11/20, 5:31:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok if you go into the schedule of work
[26/11/20, 5:32:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: There are sections which you will see highlighted “in progress”
[26/11/20, 5:32:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: We have a project communication method for example
[26/11/20, 5:32:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just take that section from the project management document
[26/11/20, 5:33:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Same thing for “Risks”
[26/11/20, 5:33:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Obviously the risks will vary a bit but the writing is relevant
[26/11/20, 5:34:13 pm] Jacob: ok cool i think i get it...yep ill start doing that
[26/11/20, 5:34:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m on a conference call so excuse me if I respond a bit late
[26/11/20, 5:34:34 pm] Jacob: all good!
[26/11/20, 5:43:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey just wanted to cross check that for website we only need these sections:

1. Home
2. About
3. Project Plan
4. Skills and Jobs
5. Group Reflections
[26/11/20, 5:46:23 pm] Jacob: looks like it to me, yep
[26/11/20, 5:46:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[26/11/20, 5:52:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should we keep a section for references so that its prominent
[26/11/20, 5:54:40 pm] Jacob: yeah couldnt hurt at all
[26/11/20, 5:54:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[26/11/20, 5:55:18 pm] Jacob: the bits from your project management thing will be blue highlights
[26/11/20, 6:24:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Good evening all. Apologies, got home just now.
[26/11/20, 6:25:30 pm] Jacob: welcome back!
[26/11/20, 6:26:02 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: You guys are working like machine for us ... thank  you sooooooo much .
[26/11/20, 6:26:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls give me some work , I can join with you
[26/11/20, 6:26:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey raj
[26/11/20, 6:26:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: No stress
[26/11/20, 6:26:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: I might not actively respond as the kids just got home
[26/11/20, 6:26:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: But im here
[26/11/20, 6:27:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Sneha , can I make a Diagram ?
‎[26/11/20, 6:27:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 6:27:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is the image ok?
[26/11/20, 6:27:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya that would be amazing raj
[26/11/20, 6:28:02 pm] Jacob: that's beautiful!
[26/11/20, 6:28:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should change the slogan though?
[26/11/20, 6:28:25 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Gorgeous.....💐😇💐
[26/11/20, 6:28:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Or the font
[26/11/20, 6:29:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Probably a bolder fobt
[26/11/20, 6:29:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: Font
[26/11/20, 6:29:21 pm] Jacob: yeah change the slogan to the one you put in the a3 draft maybe?
[26/11/20, 6:30:15 pm] Jacob: the feeling differently about life thing could be cool
[26/11/20, 6:32:50 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha , is the image size is okey for you or ?
[26/11/20, 6:37:18 pm] Jacob: sneha, can i just clarify that i am just looking for stuff to bulk out our work with? there is so much data here and a lot doesnt seem relevant
[26/11/20, 6:43:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup exactly
[26/11/20, 6:43:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just take stuff / sections which is relevant
[26/11/20, 6:43:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cross check against thr schedule of work list
[26/11/20, 6:44:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just cut and paste parts you think is needed and then i’ll cross check it
[26/11/20, 6:44:42 pm] Jacob: rightoo
[26/11/20, 6:44:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Which one?
[26/11/20, 6:45:16 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Reduced size one
[26/11/20, 6:45:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: The one I uploaded yesterday,
[26/11/20, 6:45:47 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎You deleted this message.
[26/11/20, 6:46:20 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: It’s in Image folder>team
[26/11/20, 6:46:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Haven’t checked yet
[26/11/20, 6:46:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: As it just the old ones
[26/11/20, 6:47:29 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes . I reduced its size yesterday
[26/11/20, 6:47:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[26/11/20, 6:48:27 pm] Jacob: we will probably hve to reference this document?
[26/11/20, 6:55:27 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, I’ll add the reference very shortly
[26/11/20, 7:00:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nope
[26/11/20, 7:00:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: We are changing the context. I’m going to change it
[26/11/20, 7:08:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok guys really sorry but ive got to attend the kids now. Will be back about in 2 hours properly
[26/11/20, 7:09:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: In the meantime if everyone could please do their spark feedback, sign the participation doc and finish their section of feedback
[26/11/20, 7:10:11 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Definitely
[26/11/20, 9:09:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Back to working guys. Hows everyone coming along
[26/11/20, 9:10:25 pm] Jacob: hi sneha, i copied the relevent things i could find, but couldnt find a couple of sections, like roles and communications
[26/11/20, 9:12:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[26/11/20, 9:12:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: No dramas i’ll do that now
[26/11/20, 9:13:57 pm] Jacob: awesome
[26/11/20, 9:17:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m naming the character, Amilia
[26/11/20, 9:17:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is that cool?
[26/11/20, 9:17:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sounds a bit dark
[26/11/20, 9:17:21 pm] Jacob: yep, very cool
[26/11/20, 9:17:44 pm] Jacob: i love it!
[26/11/20, 9:18:02 pm] Jacob: when do we expect to hear from Ben do you think?
[26/11/20, 9:20:54 pm] Ben: Sorry, hi, need me? 
Also as an update, I've got most of the video sections recorded and am spending a bit of time getting it all edited together. It has been a while since I've done any video messing around, so it's taking a while. :)
[26/11/20, 9:21:09 pm] Ben: Also I like Amilia, it's a nice name!
[26/11/20, 9:21:13 pm] Jacob: Hi Ben!
[26/11/20, 9:21:34 pm] Jacob: that'swonderful, thankyou for the update
[26/11/20, 9:21:57 pm] Jacob: great work Ben
[26/11/20, 9:22:09 pm] Jacob: is there anything i can help with?
[26/11/20, 9:22:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey ben, great stuff ☺️🙌
[26/11/20, 9:22:52 pm] Ben: Sorry, I've had family over and have been without my phone for most of the day.
And I actually think it should be all good, I'm hoping to either have it all done by tonight, or tomorrow morning. 
I took tomorrow off work to be sure I had time, but it hasn't taken me quite as long as I had expected.
[26/11/20, 9:23:41 pm] Jacob: that's fantastic, i have the day off too so we can tie up all the loose ends
[26/11/20, 9:28:33 pm] Ben: Also basically what I've done is this.
2:30 of the 5 mins is essentially like a monologued first person video with a silent character, while I also matched and recorded a "voice" that is constantly talking at the character. I'm still tossing up whether I do another scene for it and then decide what one to go with, but I have time for that if need be.
The second half is essentially me speaking about the impacts of mental health, the idea itself and why we decided to go with a game. Basically further explanation into everything.
[26/11/20, 9:30:22 pm] Jacob: that sounds amazing and perfect!
[26/11/20, 9:30:52 pm] Jacob: so its kind of like simulated gameplay for the first half?
[26/11/20, 9:36:51 pm] Ben: Very loosely, yeah haha. Meant to be an idea like trailer
[26/11/20, 9:37:18 pm] Jacob: noice
[26/11/20, 9:40:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey jake could you please have a look at the scope and limits section
[26/11/20, 9:40:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ive broken the game into two stages
[26/11/20, 9:41:23 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all- I’m preparing a diagram and will update you in one hour
[26/11/20, 9:41:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Put what was there earlier into stage 1, but unsure what needs to go into stage 2 of building the game
[26/11/20, 9:41:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Fantastic
[26/11/20, 9:42:03 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Dear Muz. How did you go with timeframe
[26/11/20, 9:42:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Scope description is a repetition of what if the potential of this game
‎[26/11/20, 9:43:35 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 9:44:36 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll add short description on right hand side
[26/11/20, 9:44:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Fantastic
[26/11/20, 9:45:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: This then needs to be explained in scope
[26/11/20, 9:45:37 pm] Jacob: okay Sneha, if stage one of the scope is to build the level, then perhaps stage 2 could be something about marketing it for showing to investors? like creating the video presentation that ben is doing now for example?
[26/11/20, 9:45:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Superb
[26/11/20, 9:46:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yes exactly spot on

[26/11/20, 9:49:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think i have this section
[26/11/20, 9:49:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Wait
[26/11/20, 9:50:19 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Found it . Awesom

[26/11/20, 10:04:32 pm] Jacob: scope is too
‎[26/11/20, 10:05:13 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 10:08:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Fantastic
[26/11/20, 10:08:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great job
[26/11/20, 10:09:05 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im now in group processes and communication
[26/11/20, 10:09:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: Murray can you give a heads up please when you’ll be able to get the timeframe section completed
[26/11/20, 10:10:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: We’ve kinda inserted the wordy contend but need you to complete the dates table
[26/11/20, 10:12:33 pm] Jacob: need everybody to complete their reflections too so i can write the group one
[26/11/20, 10:12:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks jake
[26/11/20, 10:15:26 pm] Ben: I'll get onto the reflection now, I forgot about that. Oops!
[26/11/20, 10:16:42 pm] Jacob: thanks ben, Raj copied your old one from A2 to A3
[26/11/20, 10:17:36 pm] Ben: Awesome, I might change it up a bit so that we have some differences, but that saves me a bunch of time haha
[26/11/20, 10:18:09 pm] Jacob: yeah please do, then i can have more to write about in the group reflection!
[26/11/20, 10:20:04 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, what will be five stages of Scope?
[26/11/20, 10:20:29 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m lost 🙁
[26/11/20, 10:20:41 pm] Jacob: we just have two stages of scope, one is building the game and the other is marketing the game
‎[26/11/20, 10:20:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 10:21:43 pm] Jacob: yeah do those Raj, the how will we do it section that you wrote
[26/11/20, 10:22:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Scope is a overview of goals. So its the same phases
[26/11/20, 10:22:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll mention it on left hand side
[26/11/20, 10:22:35 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll mention it on right hand side
‎[26/11/20, 10:23:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 10:23:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Raj just put the bullet point “Stage 1 - Project Planning”
[26/11/20, 10:23:28 pm] Jacob: 1. project planning, 2. preparing game design document, 3. production, 4. testing, 5. mareting
[26/11/20, 10:23:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Exactly
[26/11/20, 10:23:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: And then below write refer to section ...
‎[26/11/20, 10:24:06 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎GIF omitted
[26/11/20, 10:24:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: For more detailed descriptions
[26/11/20, 10:24:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😂
[26/11/20, 10:24:23 pm] Jacob: hahah
[26/11/20, 10:24:39 pm] Jacob: i love that Raj!
[26/11/20, 10:24:39 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Have some laugh 🤣
[26/11/20, 10:31:12 pm] Ben: I just threw some words into the form as my reflection, I hope that works :D
[26/11/20, 10:31:40 pm] Jacob: thanks ben, that's awesome
[26/11/20, 10:39:47 pm] Ben: Also in case you missed it (or I did in the mass of messages) don't forget to contribute on Sparkplus!
[26/11/20, 10:39:50 pm] Ben: 😊
[26/11/20, 10:43:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks ben
[26/11/20, 10:44:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you also sign the contribution word doc in the teams folder ☺️
[26/11/20, 10:44:42 pm] Ben: Can do!
[26/11/20, 10:44:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jake can you quickly check the group processes and communication
[26/11/20, 10:44:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Tq
[26/11/20, 10:51:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just check that it makes sense
[26/11/20, 10:52:19 pm] Jacob: yup
[26/11/20, 10:52:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[26/11/20, 10:56:10 pm] Jacob: wow it's a lot!
[26/11/20, 10:56:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol
[26/11/20, 10:56:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is that good or bad
[26/11/20, 10:57:04 pm] Jacob: haha
[26/11/20, 10:58:08 pm] Jacob: its great, but i nonestly think the external stakeholders bit is overkill, the assignment requirement only asks for communication between group members
[26/11/20, 10:59:27 pm] Jacob: maybe the other bit would be more useful in the marketing section?
[26/11/20, 11:01:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: External stakeholders is really important
[26/11/20, 11:01:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: External stakeholders include those who you are going to sell to
[26/11/20, 11:02:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Which is why the communication and how what means you will use to promote your game go hand in hand
[26/11/20, 11:03:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: But hey i just read the section
[26/11/20, 11:03:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya lets cut it out
[26/11/20, 11:04:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe cut it down..
‎[26/11/20, 11:04:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 11:05:28 pm] Jacob: sure okay, we could incorporate it into other sections though if it's really valuable, that fits to the new part 2 of our scope now i think 😀
[26/11/20, 11:05:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup that sounds abt right
[26/11/20, 11:06:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should i move it under scope
[26/11/20, 11:06:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Or you want to do it
[26/11/20, 11:09:33 pm] Jacob: what about the plans and progress section? cause it is kind of like detailed description of how we will achieve the scope/aim?
[26/11/20, 11:09:37 pm] Jacob: what do you think?
[26/11/20, 11:10:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think that was something murray was meant to be doing
[26/11/20, 11:10:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Haven’t heard from him today
[26/11/20, 11:10:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hope all is well
[26/11/20, 11:11:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: But ya the two go together. Scope is the most important part and your planning what you would do to develop, execute and promote your game
[26/11/20, 11:14:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey i think i have become blind.. where is the scope section
[26/11/20, 11:15:17 pm] Jacob: page 11!
[26/11/20, 11:15:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Tq 😂
[26/11/20, 11:24:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok i think that look better now in scope
[26/11/20, 11:25:52 pm] Jacob: 👍awesome
[26/11/20, 11:26:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jake im probably going to work on this for another half hour and head to bed. Really burnt. Get up early and get back into it
‎[26/11/20, 11:27:18 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[26/11/20, 11:27:37 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: How is it , Guys

[26/11/20, 11:29:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: No im sorry I generally would have stayed but but im really sick. But definitely get up early
[26/11/20, 11:29:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not a awful lot done
[26/11/20, 11:30:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Not much point as just need to sort the content out first and just insert it in
[26/11/20, 11:30:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: All the section formatting everything is ready
[26/11/20, 11:30:42 pm] Jacob: oh so we just need to insert text kind of thing?
[26/11/20, 11:30:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup exactly
[26/11/20, 11:30:58 pm] Jacob: i dont really understand the process sorry
[26/11/20, 11:31:00 pm] Jacob: yeah cool
[26/11/20, 11:31:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Dont need to create anything
[26/11/20, 11:31:07 pm] Jacob: well i know how to do that!
[26/11/20, 11:31:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: The structure is the hardest part
[26/11/20, 11:31:30 pm] Jacob: oh good
[26/11/20, 11:31:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: If you have that set, then you just need to insert the contends
[26/11/20, 11:31:40 pm] Jacob: nice
[26/11/20, 11:31:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: But a nice video would be good
[26/11/20, 11:32:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Or some moving images
[26/11/20, 11:32:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s always a brownie point for getting good marks
[26/11/20, 11:32:51 pm] Jacob: yeah cool well lets see how far we get tomorrow then!
[26/11/20, 11:32:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys should we do the timeframe?
[26/11/20, 11:33:02 pm] Jacob: should be right if me, you and ben are all at home
[26/11/20, 11:33:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: Do either of you know how to do it
[26/11/20, 11:33:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’m home all day, dedicated the day for the assignment
[26/11/20, 11:33:54 pm] Jacob: fantastic

[27/11/20, 8:57:56 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, I couldn’t handle pressure- so I thought I’ll take off
[27/11/20, 8:58:02 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 😂
[27/11/20, 8:58:10 am] Jacob: Good idea!
[27/11/20, 8:58:18 am] Sneha RMIT: 😂😂
[27/11/20, 9:30:46 am] Sneha RMIT: Ben how are you coming along?
[27/11/20, 9:31:00 am] Sneha RMIT: Do you need any help with the document
[27/11/20, 9:32:02 am] Sneha RMIT: Muz could you please give a heads up where your at? We haven’t heard from you.
[27/11/20, 9:34:28 am] Ben: Heya, so plan for this morning for me is to finish the last section of recording and then get it all edited together. I need to finalise my script first, but I expect to have that done shortly. Still getting up haha.
Only thing I'm a bit wary in is the storyboard that needs to be done with it. But I plan on worrying about that once the video is done, mostly because I can work from that to make the storyboard as well as it being less marks than the video itself.
[27/11/20, 9:35:59 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool. You focus on that. We’ll touch base again around 12.30
[27/11/20, 9:36:48 am] Sneha RMIT: And if you need help we’ll go through that together 😊
[27/11/20, 9:37:06 am] Sneha RMIT: I’m myself just getting up
[27/11/20, 9:37:16 am] Sneha RMIT: Went to bed at 4
[27/11/20, 9:37:35 am] Jacob: ☕
[27/11/20, 9:37:38 am] Jacob: me too
[27/11/20, 9:37:55 am] Sneha RMIT: Haha yea i need coffee too
[27/11/20, 9:39:20 am] Sneha RMIT: Everyone please sign the contribution doc. As soon as it gets done. We can create it into a pdf and do a separate submission.
[27/11/20, 9:41:02 am] Ben: Sounds good to me!
[27/11/20, 9:41:16 am] Ben: Also don't be too tired Sneha! Take care of yourself a bit haha
[27/11/20, 9:41:35 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Ben🙌
[27/11/20, 9:41:39 am] Sneha RMIT: Thanks ben 😊
[27/11/20, 9:44:16 am] Jacob: can we start uploading sneha, last time it took a lot longer than expected
[27/11/20, 9:44:21 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Muz, I’m bit worried, Are you oke?
[27/11/20, 9:54:41 am] Sneha RMIT: Yup absolutely
[27/11/20, 9:55:27 am] Sneha RMIT: Just getting the kids out and now the house is “peaceful” i’ll jump right into it 😁
[27/11/20, 9:55:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣🤣
[27/11/20, 9:56:18 am] Jacob: haha good stuff!
[27/11/20, 9:58:03 am] Jacob: let's just run with the table Murray has made and if we get time later we can polish the section up a bit? the assignment only asks for a table so should be right.
[27/11/20, 9:58:30 am] Jacob: i think we just need to focus on getting something done and delivered from now and we can improve later if we get time
[27/11/20, 9:59:13 am] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤝
‎[27/11/20, 10:03:34 am] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 10:04:53 am] Jacob: we can upload it to github and link to it on the pdf like jordan did for a2
[27/11/20, 10:06:04 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Thanks for that , Jacob🙏🏼 do we need screenshots of WhatsApp too?
[27/11/20, 10:06:55 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I took 7 screenshots
[27/11/20, 10:07:45 am] Jacob: i dont think it's necessary, we got really good marks last time, but sure if there's some bits that you think we need to highlight, then go for it!
[27/11/20, 10:08:43 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh. Thank you 🙏🏼 we don’t required it then🤣 we have plenty of things to do anyway
[27/11/20, 10:09:12 am] Jacob: did you see the one that jordan made for A2?
[27/11/20, 10:09:41 am] Rajaneesh Nair: No Jacob know! I’ll check it now
[27/11/20, 10:09:49 am] Jacob: A2 - evidence form.pdf
[27/11/20, 10:11:26 am] Jacob: im starting to make a document that will be the finished report that we can convert to pdf for submission

[27/11/20, 10:21:06 am] Jacob: nice!
[27/11/20, 10:21:42 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Needs to add WhatsApp GitHub link
[27/11/20, 10:22:13 am] Jacob: yep cool, we can add it at the end
[27/11/20, 10:22:48 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I uploaded WhatsApp chat history in document as as .txt form in Team
[27/11/20, 10:25:28 am] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m going to do spark plus
[27/11/20, 10:31:14 am] Sneha RMIT: Yea so we need to upload the entire chat history. And take a couple of good examples of our interaction, good points of discussion
[27/11/20, 10:32:36 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool. Just check the formatting is consistent throughout and also yesterday night i put our logo in the header. Check please if that’s here

[27/11/20, 10:54:30 am] Murray: Hi guys so sorry have had 48 hours from hell with work and a few family issues. 

I have meetings all day today as well :’(. Let me know what is waiting on me and I can try smash it out today. Is it due midnight?

(Also please feel free to say I didn’t very little on this assignment in the review.)
[27/11/20, 11:03:32 am] Sneha RMIT: Ok guys sorry to sound selfish but im going ditch you guys for an hour and not communicate at all.... 😂
[27/11/20, 11:03:50 am] Sneha RMIT: Just going to nuckle down and get the website done
[27/11/20, 11:04:49 am] Rajaneesh Nair: Go for it pls . You definitely need some concentration 🤛
[27/11/20, 12:03:52 pm] Jacob: Hi Muz, I’m speaking on behalf of the group now. Thanks for getting back to us. We appreciate how busy you are, with work and family life, but this week has been the critical time where most of the work has been done and we feel like the work load has been a lot especially after losing Jordan. 
We are at the point where we just need to finish the website, and PDF and submit what we have already.
At the moment our contribution form says 20% each, but we feel like we need to redistribute this to make it fairer and wanted to give you the opportunity to say what you think is right and what percentage you think is fair.
[27/11/20, 12:05:21 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m agree with you Jacob. I’m so stressed and high level of depression
[27/11/20, 12:05:36 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🙁🥲
[27/11/20, 12:05:54 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just take a deep breathe raj. All is well
[27/11/20, 12:06:26 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Wife pushing me to hospital - too much work load ... 🥲
[27/11/20, 12:06:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its a assignment and not your entire life. We’ll be fine
[27/11/20, 12:06:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Dont stress out
[27/11/20, 12:06:52 pm] Jacob: sorry to hear that raj :(
[27/11/20, 12:06:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: We’re nearly done
[27/11/20, 12:07:05 pm] Sneha RMIT: And get a extension for programming.
[27/11/20, 12:07:08 pm] Jacob: We will be fine
[27/11/20, 12:07:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve got focus music on in the background 😂😂😂

[27/11/20, 2:38:18 pm] Jacob: i started on a new one but its probably best to stick to the original and just work from one
[27/11/20, 2:38:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea that’s the best idea
[27/11/20, 2:40:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Who’s got free ✋ hands
[27/11/20, 2:44:53 pm] Jacob: yup do now

[27/11/20, 3:02:22 pm] Jacob: so those first two pages are good, all links work, all images work
‎[27/11/20, 3:02:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 3:03:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should we keep the bullet points or not
[27/11/20, 3:04:13 pm] Jacob: i think not, but maybe indent the second line like this example? https://guides.lib.monash.edu/citing-referencing/apa-sample-reference-list
[27/11/20, 3:04:25 pm] Jacob: also, extra brownie points for alphabetising
[27/11/20, 3:04:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya im trying to code the indentation
[27/11/20, 3:14:32 pm] Jacob: sneha, some of this stuff still looks like it is copied directly from a project management assignment and doesn't seem to relate to this game designing project
[27/11/20, 3:15:33 pm] Jacob: like the bit above the timeframe table and a lot of the scope section
[27/11/20, 3:16:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea that section definitely needs changing
[27/11/20, 3:16:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: But scope is not too bad
[27/11/20, 3:16:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: If you can though look through it
[27/11/20, 3:16:48 pm] Jacob: oh good okay
[27/11/20, 3:18:33 pm] Jacob: (2)    Involving media consultation companies -

[27/11/20, 3:18:40 pm] Jacob: what is all that stuff for example?
[27/11/20, 3:19:15 pm] Jacob: what is bain media lab?
[27/11/20, 3:20:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: They are a media company
[27/11/20, 3:20:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Change it to suit what we need
[27/11/20, 3:20:47 pm] Jacob: but i think what we need is very simple and was covered by the first two stages of the scope that we had before
[27/11/20, 3:21:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Point that should have been made was we need to work hand in hand with media consulting firms to promote our game project
[27/11/20, 3:21:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: No scope is quite detailed
[27/11/20, 3:21:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Very large percentage of marks go for that
[27/11/20, 3:21:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: But definitely go through and cut down on whats not required in your eyes
[27/11/20, 3:21:59 pm] Jacob: they suggest minimum 1 paragraph
[27/11/20, 3:22:29 pm] Jacob: "For example, if you are developing a game, you might consider only producing one level and two or three characters, in order to show a proof-of- concept, rather than develop three levels and ten characters."
[27/11/20, 3:22:42 pm] Jacob: that is what they are looking for in scope according to assignment doc
[27/11/20, 3:23:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: The limitations of scope is very important
[27/11/20, 3:23:17 pm] Jacob: absolutely, but it has to be concise
[27/11/20, 3:23:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup that is need but hadn’t had a chance to finish it
[27/11/20, 3:23:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Maybe buid on that and chuck what you feel
[27/11/20, 3:24:08 pm] Jacob: it is only one part of the detailed description which is worth 50 marks
[27/11/20, 3:24:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: But the biggest part
[27/11/20, 3:24:56 pm] Jacob: no! not the biggest part!
[27/11/20, 3:25:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sure, Jacob
[27/11/20, 3:25:03 pm] Jacob: the biggest part is plans and progress
[27/11/20, 3:25:34 pm] Jacob: they say the scope is the most crucial, and most difficult to define but not biggest
‎[27/11/20, 3:26:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 3:26:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Whatever you feel fits best in this, go for it
[27/11/20, 3:26:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just cut what you feel necessary
[27/11/20, 3:28:56 pm] Jacob: ok let me go through it
[27/11/20, 3:29:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks 😊
[27/11/20, 3:29:26 pm] Jacob: im sorry to sound bossy
[27/11/20, 3:29:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey not at all
[27/11/20, 3:29:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: You just want the best
[27/11/20, 3:30:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: So do i 😊✋ we’re on the same page
[27/11/20, 3:30:48 pm] Jacob: ok great 🤚
[27/11/20, 3:36:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Struggling to fix the formatting in referencing
[27/11/20, 3:36:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😫
‎[27/11/20, 3:37:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 3:37:16 pm] Jacob: hey, disregard it, it's a very minor detail!
[27/11/20, 3:37:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s the best i have got so far
[27/11/20, 3:37:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[27/11/20, 3:37:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Moving on
[27/11/20, 3:37:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its giving me a headache
[27/11/20, 3:37:42 pm] Jacob: yeah dont worry, it's great
[27/11/20, 3:38:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok so uploaded references and pic reference ideas
[27/11/20, 3:39:41 pm] Jacob: Nice
[27/11/20, 3:40:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Moving onto skills and jobs section
[27/11/20, 3:40:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Leave project plan for last
[27/11/20, 3:40:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Raj can you do me a favour
[27/11/20, 3:41:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Please find a nice video on YouTube related to skills required game developers
[27/11/20, 3:53:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Going pretty well guys
[27/11/20, 3:53:37 pm] Sneha RMIT: 70% completed
[27/11/20, 3:54:13 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Okey, Sneha
[27/11/20, 3:55:22 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Done , will get back to you in one minute
[27/11/20, 3:56:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😊 thanks
[27/11/20, 4:01:35 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: i like this one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txx5qA_42Ls
[27/11/20, 4:01:48 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: let  me see if i can find better one
[27/11/20, 4:02:37 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5ZadzDKfsM
[27/11/20, 4:05:14 pm] Jacob: i edited scope to only say what it will do, what it will not do and talk about scope creep, as per the assignment sheet
[27/11/20, 4:05:39 pm] Jacob: i hope it's ok, i tink it answers the questions more directly
[27/11/20, 4:05:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Do you want me to add some materials by extracting from this site, Sneha?
[27/11/20, 4:06:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: https://www.petersons.com/blog/10-skills-you-need-to-become-a-video-game-designer/
[27/11/20, 4:09:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, I added the tittle and GitHub link for assignment 3 draft. We will cross check at the end before converting to PDF
[27/11/20, 4:12:31 pm] Jacob: cool raj, i just put the actual website link there too
[27/11/20, 4:12:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry guys my brain has just gone numb
[27/11/20, 4:12:55 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sure
[27/11/20, 4:13:01 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤛
[27/11/20, 4:13:09 pm] Jacob: 🤜
[27/11/20, 4:13:12 pm] Jacob: hahaha
[27/11/20, 4:14:12 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Don’t stress Sneha . We are close to finishing line 🙌
[27/11/20, 4:15:12 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-3-Group-Work-Repository/
[27/11/20, 4:15:25 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: this is the one, right, Jacob/
[27/11/20, 4:15:35 pm] Jacob: Yep!
[27/11/20, 4:15:46 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻
[27/11/20, 4:15:49 pm] Jacob: They are both included in the tools section too
[27/11/20, 4:16:11 pm] Jacob: One for the website, one for the repository
[27/11/20, 4:16:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: References images is not coming up
[27/11/20, 4:18:59 pm] Jacob: oh
[27/11/20, 4:21:13 pm] Jacob: maybe just wait a bit, it's working on my prieview
[27/11/20, 4:21:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im just working on skills n jobs
[27/11/20, 4:21:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Wont look into anything until you say your ready
[27/11/20, 4:22:33 pm] Jacob: just check typo on 'references' sneha
[27/11/20, 4:22:45 pm] Jacob: in the menu
[27/11/20, 4:22:54 pm] Jacob: ill fix it on the pages i already have
[27/11/20, 4:23:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok thanks
[27/11/20, 4:27:37 pm] Jacob: got that image working
[27/11/20, 4:27:49 pm] Jacob: is skills an jobs ok?
[27/11/20, 4:31:07 pm] Jacob: we need a section for the actual image of the game that raj drew too!
[27/11/20, 4:31:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should we called it game design maybe
[27/11/20, 4:31:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Create a section
[27/11/20, 4:32:16 pm] Jacob: yeah good idea
[27/11/20, 4:32:34 pm] Jacob: hey ben, are you there?
[27/11/20, 4:32:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Before or after game plan
[27/11/20, 4:33:05 pm] Jacob: i guess after?
[27/11/20, 4:33:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Don’t beat me , not now , later ..We need Communication Evidence document is in GitHub end of the day ,
[27/11/20, 4:33:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cool
[27/11/20, 4:34:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry calling it game design
[27/11/20, 4:35:58 pm] Jacob: if we put a bit of dialog with the picture maybe, to kind of show what is happening in the game
[27/11/20, 4:36:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: so that will mean in this section you will need to insert a code
[27/11/20, 4:36:10 pm] Jacob: like what the demon is sayiong to her at that moment?
‎[27/11/20, 4:36:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 4:36:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sounds great
[27/11/20, 4:36:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: More visual
[27/11/20, 4:36:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Which is what the assessor wrote last time
[27/11/20, 4:37:14 pm] Jacob: yeah....i have a feeling that ben will have some dialog from the video that we could add
[27/11/20, 4:37:46 pm] Jacob: so sneha i need to add that game design link in each menu?
[27/11/20, 4:37:54 pm] Jacob: excellent
[27/11/20, 4:38:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup correct
[27/11/20, 4:38:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: So automatically when you upload the file it will be linked
[27/11/20, 4:39:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s be really nice
[27/11/20, 4:45:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Under skills
[27/11/20, 4:45:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Do we use any of the general skills etc from last time
[27/11/20, 4:47:23 pm] Jacob: sorry, can you refresh my memory about the skills from last time?
‎[27/11/20, 4:48:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
‎[27/11/20, 4:48:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 4:49:45 pm] Jacob: oh cool, yeah, it relates, i believe the idea for the skills and jobs section of this assignment is kind of like how you would advertise for the positions on seek
[27/11/20, 4:49:47 pm] Jacob: so yes
[27/11/20, 4:50:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup that’s right
[27/11/20, 4:50:23 pm] Jacob: "15-12 Marks
You have comprehensively, clearly, and concisely identified the skills appropriate to your project and have written 4 position descriptions that clearly and accurately specify all of the skills, qualifications and experience needed to a standard that would be appropriate to be published on a careers website."
[27/11/20, 4:50:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Getting rid of the individual stuff
[27/11/20, 4:51:02 pm] Jacob: yeah, just designing 4 positions that we would need to complete the project
[27/11/20, 4:51:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: But maybe a few key skill set requirements for each role
[27/11/20, 4:51:35 pm] Jacob: yeah that's what i tried to do, but maybe it could be done better
[27/11/20, 4:51:53 pm] Jacob: there is also another section called 'roles' which is more about us i think
[27/11/20, 4:52:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you write 3 bullet points for each- either IT specific or general
[27/11/20, 4:52:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup saw that
[27/11/20, 4:53:31 pm] Jacob: yep
[27/11/20, 5:03:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cool
‎[27/11/20, 5:03:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
‎[27/11/20, 5:03:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 5:04:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Once you send the bullet points
[27/11/20, 5:21:27 pm] Jacob: ok they are done :)
[27/11/20, 5:22:23 pm] Murray: Look I totally agree. I think whatever you guys think is fair is ok by me. You guys are awesome and I really admire how hard you worked on this considering all your situations so I think you deserve all the credit in the world.

I’m really sorry I’ve been such a weak link.
[27/11/20, 5:24:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: All good muz. I know juggling multiple commitments can be challenging. It might be a good idea to get some guidance so you can talk and plan
[27/11/20, 5:25:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Seriously guys my back and head hurts really bad
[27/11/20, 5:26:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: After I finish skills im going to have a bit of a break
[27/11/20, 5:33:21 pm] Jacob: all good sneha, ill try to polish up what i can of the remaining sections while you're away and we can get back to httml later
‎[27/11/20, 5:34:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 5:34:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: This section is nearly done
[27/11/20, 5:38:34 pm] Jacob: thanks for understanding muz, i think it's been a pretty wild ride for everybody these past few months
[27/11/20, 5:38:50 pm] Jacob: top work sneha
[27/11/20, 5:43:55 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Looks so elegant ....
[27/11/20, 5:44:05 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 🤝
‎[27/11/20, 5:47:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 5:47:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you guys write a finishing 1 to 2 sentences for skills and jobs
[27/11/20, 5:48:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Why having the right people with a strong skill set is important for the team
[27/11/20, 5:49:38 pm] Jacob: yep, just tweaking the timeframe section now but ill get onto it soon
[27/11/20, 5:49:52 pm] Jacob: unless you want to raj
[27/11/20, 5:50:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks. Ya maybe raj you do it
[27/11/20, 5:50:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just 1-2 sentences
[27/11/20, 5:56:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok skills is done
[27/11/20, 5:56:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just need the write up
[27/11/20, 5:57:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: You will need the “dark mind” pic in this section
[27/11/20, 5:58:57 pm] Jacob: great
[27/11/20, 6:00:44 pm] Ben: https://youtu.be/88OJyGFk7zc

I'm so unsure on it, I am just not sure I could get it being the way I wanted. That being said, we have 2 seperate parts to it to try and keep it a little bit more interesting.
Let me know, and hopefully it isn't all terrible 😂
[27/11/20, 6:01:11 pm] Ben: But with limited ability as well, it was interesting to put together.
[27/11/20, 6:07:49 pm] Jacob: that's great Ben, it's really eerie and dark, i like it
[27/11/20, 6:08:15 pm] Jacob: and what a beautiful place you live in!
[27/11/20, 6:08:17 pm] Ben: My backyard makes for decent darknesses haha
[27/11/20, 6:08:25 pm] Jacob: yrah it
[27/11/20, 6:08:31 pm] Jacob: yeah it's mazing
[27/11/20, 6:08:55 pm] Ben: Haha it is nice for sure
[27/11/20, 6:08:58 pm] Jacob: how far out of melbourne is that?
[27/11/20, 6:12:54 pm] Ben: About 50 minutes drive east of the CBD. So not too far.
[27/11/20, 6:17:15 pm] Jacob: hey, sneha, you only gave me the picture, not the html
[27/11/20, 6:17:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: I need the last blurb of 1-2 sentences
[27/11/20, 6:17:59 pm] Jacob: oh sure, yep, okay
[27/11/20, 6:18:02 pm] Jacob: hang on
[27/11/20, 6:18:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thnx
[27/11/20, 6:20:17 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Outstanding, Ben...
[27/11/20, 6:20:43 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: We will get one extra mark for this video
[27/11/20, 6:21:15 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Lovely background
[27/11/20, 6:24:07 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great work. We are nearly done
[27/11/20, 6:33:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Waitng on that last blurb to finish off skills section
[27/11/20, 6:41:29 pm] Jacob: done
[27/11/20, 6:41:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[27/11/20, 6:43:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Jake did you get rid of all the limitations section under scope...
[27/11/20, 6:50:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Skills n jobs uploaded now
[27/11/20, 6:50:46 pm] Sneha RMIT: Last section to go
[27/11/20, 6:51:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh hang on
[27/11/20, 6:51:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: We’ve got the section for game design
[27/11/20, 6:55:33 pm] Jacob: maybe...hang on let me see
[27/11/20, 6:55:33 pm] Jacob: i saved it all separately
[27/11/20, 6:56:11 pm] Jacob: i cut most of scope out to leave just what i thought the question was asking
[27/11/20, 6:57:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: What about the limitations of the scope
[27/11/20, 6:57:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: There is no mention of it now
[27/11/20, 6:58:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Do you have a backed up copy of tjat section
[27/11/20, 6:58:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: Cos I didn’t save anything
[27/11/20, 6:58:48 pm] Jacob: yeah its all in 'what jake cut out of scope' in teams
[27/11/20, 6:59:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh cool
[27/11/20, 7:00:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: I dont actually know how to see the old contend
[27/11/20, 7:01:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Are you able to put back in the limitations
[27/11/20, 7:01:29 pm] Jacob: i just added what we will not do in our build, i.e the limitations of our scope, not the limitations of a scope in general
[27/11/20, 7:01:32 pm] Jacob: yep hangon
[27/11/20, 7:01:47 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I feel like worth nothing .. I couldn’t help you all
[27/11/20, 7:02:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: Dont be like that
[27/11/20, 7:02:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lets all just stay positive ❤️
[27/11/20, 7:02:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: We have done superb
[27/11/20, 7:02:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just few more hours
[27/11/20, 7:02:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hang in there and later we can scream 🤯🥶
[27/11/20, 7:03:07 pm] Ben: Hopefully this will be a positive, I have submitted assignment 5!
We are so closez keep it up everyone!
[27/11/20, 7:03:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks ben
[27/11/20, 7:03:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Has everyone signed the contribution doc
[27/11/20, 7:04:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: Also raj need to check that everything is in the communications doc
[27/11/20, 7:05:43 pm] Jacob: everything i cut out is back there, highlighted in yellow
[27/11/20, 7:06:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[27/11/20, 7:06:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[27/11/20, 7:08:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok i’ve changed that
[27/11/20, 7:09:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Where do i find the content for game design
[27/11/20, 7:11:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Raj are you now using the communications doc on teams?
[27/11/20, 7:11:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should we just cross check everything on that
[27/11/20, 7:14:25 pm] Jacob: ah, that is in image folder in teams
[27/11/20, 7:14:57 pm] Jacob: skills and jobs is running, but image is not working yet for some reason
[27/11/20, 7:15:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: Probably need to change the name of file
[27/11/20, 7:15:36 pm] Jacob: oh now it is, no it was just taking it's time :)
[27/11/20, 7:18:13 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok group reflection updated
[27/11/20, 7:18:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Just added that updated version on teams
[27/11/20, 7:19:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: It replaced the old doc
[27/11/20, 7:19:09 pm] Jacob: Ok cool
[27/11/20, 7:19:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: Now will do the game design
[27/11/20, 7:21:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: Does game design section have any content aside from images
[27/11/20, 7:23:41 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ben could you get some images with descriptions please for game design
[27/11/20, 7:24:49 pm] Ben: I'll see what I can find. I'm now not home again 🙃
But I can work mobile, so bear with me haha
[27/11/20, 7:25:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[27/11/20, 7:25:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[27/11/20, 7:25:35 pm] Ben: What sort of images were you needing? Or descriptions rather?
[27/11/20, 7:27:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: To do with the game design
[27/11/20, 7:28:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys please need you guys to talk
[27/11/20, 7:29:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: A couple of pics for a section one be sufficient
[27/11/20, 7:29:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: We need some write up
‎[27/11/20, 7:29:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 7:40:26 pm] Ben: Let me have a look
[27/11/20, 7:40:30 pm] Jacob: hey ben, you know the scene that raj drew for the game?
[27/11/20, 7:41:28 pm] Jacob: what if you could just write something, like a little dialog from the demon and maybe an example of one of the misleading choices kind of thing, to make it a complete scene?
[27/11/20, 7:43:29 pm] Jacob: that, combined with the video could be our 'tangible artifacts'
[27/11/20, 7:44:55 pm] Ben: That I can do much easier on the phone.
If you find the pics for Sneha, I'll get that written asap
[27/11/20, 7:47:02 pm] Jacob: awesome thatd be great ben
[27/11/20, 7:47:06 pm] Jacob: hey sneha
[27/11/20, 7:47:33 pm] Jacob: are we making another section to raj's scene as our tangible artifact?
[27/11/20, 7:47:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup
[27/11/20, 7:48:00 pm] Jacob: ah awesome
[27/11/20, 7:48:03 pm] Jacob: so ben is writing that up
[27/11/20, 7:48:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: Game design is where i put his stuff
‎[27/11/20, 7:48:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 7:48:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: But doesn’t make sense with just one image
‎[27/11/20, 7:48:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 7:48:52 pm] Jacob: oh no, yeah, i mean the other one, with the girl and the demon in the street
[27/11/20, 7:49:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ve put this here
[27/11/20, 7:49:20 pm] Ben: Where should I start writing lol? Section wise I mean
[27/11/20, 7:49:38 pm] Jacob: for the scene ben, an example of gameplay
[27/11/20, 7:49:54 pm] Ben: Sure, I'll come up with something.
[27/11/20, 7:49:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea some screen shots would be amazing
[27/11/20, 7:50:01 pm] Jacob: awesome
[27/11/20, 7:50:05 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks ben
[27/11/20, 7:50:26 pm] Jacob: so we should have a separate section for that yeah sneha?
[27/11/20, 7:50:48 pm] Jacob: like "Gameplay"
[27/11/20, 7:51:17 pm] Jacob: and have our scene and what the demon is saying and a choice that the player must make
[27/11/20, 7:51:26 pm] Ben: I'll make a section labelled, gameplay example, and out it after the landscape section
[27/11/20, 7:52:03 pm] Jacob: yeah awesome
[27/11/20, 7:58:43 pm] Jacob: do you have the evidence form ready raj?
[27/11/20, 7:58:57 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes , Jacob
[27/11/20, 7:59:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: We need to add the Girhub file link for WhatsApp
[27/11/20, 7:59:14 pm] Jacob: 👍 awesome
[27/11/20, 7:59:40 pm] Jacob: ok so , we'll download an updated file at the end?
[27/11/20, 7:59:55 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes.
[27/11/20, 8:00:06 pm] Jacob: nice
[27/11/20, 8:00:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[27/11/20, 8:00:14 pm] Jacob: so we are almost ready!
[27/11/20, 8:00:36 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: WhatsApp conversation till afternoon 2.40 pm I think.
[27/11/20, 8:00:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: Did you get the whatsapp screenshots and the schedule of work file inserted in there
[27/11/20, 8:02:25 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: According to Jacob, we don’t need screenshotes but we need chat record
[27/11/20, 8:03:05 pm] Sneha RMIT: No you dont need it, it’s optional
[27/11/20, 8:03:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: But if you have it, it looks good
[27/11/20, 8:03:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I completed schedule of work
[27/11/20, 8:04:01 pm] Jacob: yeah if you have time raj, it will be better than the last one!
[27/11/20, 8:04:11 pm] Jacob: hey guys, with the timeframe table
[27/11/20, 8:04:31 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Do you want me to insert schedule chart in communication file?
[27/11/20, 8:04:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: You mean you put the link into the communications doc
[27/11/20, 8:04:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Insert it in
[27/11/20, 8:04:59 pm] Jacob: do you think i should change it so it is a timeframe of how we would build the actual project? right now it is a timeframe of how we have done the assignment
[27/11/20, 8:05:14 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Got it Sneha . I’ll do it right now
[27/11/20, 8:05:18 pm] Sneha RMIT: No its fine
[27/11/20, 8:05:29 pm] Sneha RMIT: Timeframes can change
[27/11/20, 8:05:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Which is why there is the comments section
[27/11/20, 8:07:14 pm] Jacob: ok cool
‎[27/11/20, 8:08:15 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 8:09:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yes there was a proper minutes of meeting i created which should be in the last assignment folders
[27/11/20, 8:09:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: You can use that and change the dates etc
[27/11/20, 8:10:24 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: 👍🏻👍🏻
‎[27/11/20, 8:21:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 8:21:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: This is coming along like this
[27/11/20, 8:21:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is that ok
[27/11/20, 8:22:03 pm] Jacob: looks awesome!
[27/11/20, 8:22:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😊✋
[27/11/20, 8:23:42 pm] Jacob: ✋
[27/11/20, 8:24:04 pm] Jacob: do i need to find references for those photos?
[27/11/20, 8:25:43 pm] Ben: I added a file called gameplay and idea or similar into the teams folder.
I couldn't add it directly to our file without downloading it entirely and replacing what's there already.... Damn phone writing
[27/11/20, 8:26:08 pm] Jacob: ok cool ill have a look
[27/11/20, 8:27:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: There is some references already here
[27/11/20, 8:28:59 pm] Jacob: ok ni e
[27/11/20, 8:29:30 pm] Jacob: alright i just put ben's new work into the draft file and i will match it up with Raj's beautiful scene
[27/11/20, 8:31:50 pm] Jacob: can you just check what i did sneha in case it has interfered with anything you have done on the website
[27/11/20, 8:32:01 pm] Jacob: i put it under plans and progress
[27/11/20, 8:37:25 pm] Jacob: I just added this above the photo, like a captionDemon: “Why are you going outside? Nobody wants to see you”
[27/11/20, 8:38:17 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: hi Jacob, pls go through communication evidence document. I know , you are exhausted 🙁
[27/11/20, 8:38:34 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Pls let me know if you want me to add anything more
[27/11/20, 8:38:48 pm] Jacob: sure Raj, no all gosd 😊
[27/11/20, 8:38:49 pm] Jacob: good
[27/11/20, 8:39:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya i just stoped 😂
[27/11/20, 8:39:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey we dont need to put tools n technologies on the website do we?
[27/11/20, 8:40:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: If we do... thatvwould mean we need to create another section
[27/11/20, 8:40:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: 🤦‍♀️😅
[27/11/20, 8:41:00 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Omg.
[27/11/20, 8:42:03 pm] Jacob: no, in this assignment, the tools and technologies section is part of the plans and progress
[27/11/20, 8:42:47 pm] Jacob: so we can just put it in 'project plan' and it simply includes the links and the audit trail
[27/11/20, 8:43:17 pm] Jacob: and now that i think about it.....surely it doesnt need to go on the website, you're right
[27/11/20, 8:43:25 pm] Jacob: just the pdf report, surely
[27/11/20, 8:44:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lol
[27/11/20, 8:45:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Im scratchinh my head
[27/11/20, 8:45:12 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should we put it in just in case
‎[27/11/20, 8:45:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 8:45:31 pm] Sneha RMIT: Is the red colour ok?
[27/11/20, 8:45:55 pm] Jacob: yeah we can, but we will just be linking to ourselves haha but yeah we can do it for the sake of thoroughness
[27/11/20, 8:46:11 pm] Sneha RMIT: How do we do that
[27/11/20, 8:46:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry misread
[27/11/20, 8:47:01 pm] Sneha RMIT: I mean it is in the pdf..
[27/11/20, 8:47:20 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😁🤷‍♀️
‎[27/11/20, 8:49:32 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 8:49:38 pm] Jacob: i just linked to ben's video as part of the 'gameplay' section so it can be used as part of our 'tangible artifacts'
[27/11/20, 8:49:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok so this is under game design?
[27/11/20, 8:50:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok great
[27/11/20, 8:50:30 pm] Jacob: yes, i think that is correct
[27/11/20, 8:50:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[27/11/20, 8:51:09 pm] Jacob: oh! but this is all part of the greater section 'plans and progress' yeah?
[27/11/20, 8:51:16 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup
[27/11/20, 8:51:21 pm] Sneha RMIT: Do one thing
[27/11/20, 8:51:27 pm] Jacob: otherwise we can take gameplay out and make it it's own section, not fussed
[27/11/20, 8:51:42 pm] Sneha RMIT: Highlight the section your working in yellow
[27/11/20, 8:52:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Below that i’ll use thr content for the project plan section
[27/11/20, 8:52:40 pm] Jacob: yep
[27/11/20, 8:58:08 pm] Jacob: that section is finished
[27/11/20, 8:58:14 pm] Jacob: thankyou for that ben
[27/11/20, 8:59:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Great
[27/11/20, 8:59:53 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thank you
[27/11/20, 9:02:24 pm] Sneha RMIT: Hey the 5 stages is part of raj’s pic
‎[27/11/20, 9:02:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 9:02:58 pm] Sneha RMIT: Shouldn’t i stick the pic where the content is
[27/11/20, 9:04:31 pm] Jacob: Well, that pic is no ordinary pic, that is our 'tangible artifact' that demonstrates our vision, so as long as it is presented as such
[27/11/20, 9:05:08 pm] Jacob: oh crikey, sorry, i misunderstood
[27/11/20, 9:05:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Should i put this section in the game design too
[27/11/20, 9:05:18 pm] Jacob: yeah, that other pic would be best there
[27/11/20, 9:05:40 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok so move the pic to this section
[27/11/20, 9:05:51 pm] Jacob: yeah i think so
[27/11/20, 9:11:03 pm] Jacob: looks good your evidence form raj
[27/11/20, 9:12:17 pm] Jacob: so we need to add github audit trail link and whatsapp group message link
[27/11/20, 9:13:21 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Yes, Jacob
[27/11/20, 9:13:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea we wrote about the github audit trail not being a true representation of work that has been done
[27/11/20, 9:13:37 pm] Jacob: yep
[27/11/20, 9:13:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: So i guess its linked to a section
[27/11/20, 9:14:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Project plan is long
[27/11/20, 9:14:12 pm] Jacob: ill add a note in raj's doc to that effct too
[27/11/20, 9:16:25 pm] Jacob: and sneha did you say you had proper minutes from all the meetings that we can add too?
[27/11/20, 9:17:18 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Oh , I can make it it you want to , Jacob
[27/11/20, 9:17:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I added that bottom of the doc as a screenshot
[27/11/20, 9:18:38 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup
[27/11/20, 9:18:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: It should be in the old assignment 2 file
‎[27/11/20, 9:19:08 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 9:29:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: Nope
[27/11/20, 9:30:55 pm] Sneha RMIT: Where is stuff from assignment 2
[27/11/20, 9:30:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: The folder

[27/11/20, 9:36:13 pm] Jacob: Yeah that’s bloody awesome, great job!
[27/11/20, 9:36:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok this section is done
[27/11/20, 9:37:00 pm] Jacob: Okie dokie nice
[27/11/20, 9:40:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: Game design page is uploaded
[27/11/20, 9:40:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: And game design pic 1
[27/11/20, 9:41:04 pm] Jacob: wonderful
[27/11/20, 9:45:38 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Got it. i am on it

[27/11/20, 9:46:17 pm] Sneha RMIT: I think so
[27/11/20, 9:46:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: Let me check
[27/11/20, 9:46:39 pm] Sneha RMIT: No sorry my bad
[27/11/20, 9:46:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Wait I’ll upload a new copy
[27/11/20, 9:46:53 pm] Jacob: No worries, okay
[27/11/20, 9:47:37 pm] Jacob: Can I be fussy and get that quote directly above the picture too? Cause I wanted that demon to be saying it
[27/11/20, 9:47:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool
[27/11/20, 9:47:54 pm] Jacob: Thanks!
[27/11/20, 9:47:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: 😎
‎[27/11/20, 9:49:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 9:49:06 pm] Sneha RMIT: That ok?
[27/11/20, 9:49:21 pm] Jacob: Perfect! Thanks
[27/11/20, 9:49:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok uploading now
[27/11/20, 9:49:51 pm] Jacob: Cool
[27/11/20, 9:50:04 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its replaced the old file
[27/11/20, 9:53:19 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: i know, i am annoying you but i could not find this 😭
[27/11/20, 9:54:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Wait i’ll put a copy in assignment 3
[27/11/20, 9:54:14 pm] Sneha RMIT: Its called pseudo boomers meeting
[27/11/20, 9:54:51 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Millions of thanks
[27/11/20, 9:56:30 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok its in assignment 3 folder now
[27/11/20, 9:59:58 pm] Jacob: woohoo! one page to go!
[27/11/20, 10:20:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Guys so we are putting in tools in the project plan section? Yes no
[27/11/20, 10:22:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Does technology, timeframe, communications, risks all in the same section
[27/11/20, 10:22:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: Does the assessment say that we actually have to have all segments in the website
[27/11/20, 10:25:19 pm] Jacob: yes, all those go into the same section, to make up the big one worth 50 marks i believe
[27/11/20, 10:25:32 pm] Jacob: hang on and ill check the assesment for that detail
[27/11/20, 10:25:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[27/11/20, 10:25:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Because its huge
[27/11/20, 10:25:56 pm] Sneha RMIT: We’d have to put another section
‎[27/11/20, 10:28:28 pm] Sneha RMIT: ‎image omitted
[27/11/20, 10:29:18 pm] Jacob: How you will demonstrate it:
Writing up a document covering all of the different areas listed above (and detailed below), to be then formatted and presented in a PDF Report. Update your group website from Assignment 2 that was hosted on GitHub Pages.
Submission of both a written PDF report and a GitHub Pages hosted website.
Start by forking your A2 GitHub repository - https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/
[27/11/20, 10:29:36 pm] Sneha RMIT: Shoot
[27/11/20, 10:29:44 pm] Sneha RMIT: So we do need a tools section
[27/11/20, 10:29:51 pm] Jacob: it says we sbould have forked the a2 repo, but i just made a new repo, do you think that is okay?
[27/11/20, 10:30:03 pm] Jacob: i think so
[27/11/20, 10:30:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok
[27/11/20, 10:30:25 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can you put the headings in all the sections
[27/11/20, 10:30:35 pm] Jacob: 5-4 Marks
You have included a link to your group’s website. You have set up your group’s Git repository and included a link to it. You have made clear and appropriate comments about your group’s log of activity.
Any other tool, platform, service used is also discussed.
[27/11/20, 10:30:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: Add it under project plan
[27/11/20, 10:30:48 pm] Jacob: thats from the tools marking
[27/11/20, 10:31:09 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ok cool so we need it on the website
[27/11/20, 10:31:25 pm] Jacob: probably
[27/11/20, 10:32:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: But here’s my issue
[27/11/20, 10:32:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Do we put everything under project plan?
[27/11/20, 10:32:52 pm] Sneha RMIT: Does testing go under tools
[27/11/20, 10:33:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Timeframe
[27/11/20, 10:33:08 pm] Sneha RMIT: I guess ya?
[27/11/20, 10:33:55 pm] Jacob: ok so it is a little bit unclear, but there is two 'tools' sections
[27/11/20, 10:34:01 pm] Jacob: did you know that?
[27/11/20, 10:34:03 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Help, Jacob, pls check the communication doc 🙏🏼
[27/11/20, 10:34:23 pm] Sneha RMIT: No I didn’t
[27/11/20, 10:34:26 pm] Sneha RMIT: Explain
[27/11/20, 10:35:52 pm] Jacob: There is one that is worth 5 points that includes github links, github repo, github audit trail comments and comments on any other tools we used i.e. we should probably add whatsapp and teams, or just copy it from A2
[27/11/20, 10:36:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup yup
[27/11/20, 10:36:12 pm] Jacob: that section is called 'Tools' and it is near the top
[27/11/20, 10:36:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s what raj is doing
[27/11/20, 10:36:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: Which is why i was talking about the whatsapp screenshots
[27/11/20, 10:36:40 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I think I finished
[27/11/20, 10:36:47 pm] Jacob: No, not exactly, that is a separate pdf document
[27/11/20, 10:36:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: And this tools is related to the project
[27/11/20, 10:37:03 pm] Jacob: the 'tools' section is part of our report
[27/11/20, 10:37:03 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yea it was a template
[27/11/20, 10:37:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: We were filling it out
[27/11/20, 10:37:19 pm] Sneha RMIT: That’s the template i gave to raj
[27/11/20, 10:37:43 pm] Sneha RMIT: I just changed the name to communication
[27/11/20, 10:37:55 pm] Jacob: and then there is 'tools and technology' which is a section that murray did and that goes under the big one 'project plan'
[27/11/20, 10:37:59 pm] Sneha RMIT: But its actually meant to be like the evidence portfolio
[27/11/20, 10:38:15 pm] Sneha RMIT: Huh
[27/11/20, 10:38:22 pm] Sneha RMIT: Now im confused
[27/11/20, 10:38:34 pm] Sneha RMIT: Can u show me a pic please
[27/11/20, 10:38:35 pm] Jacob: yep, so now we are talking about 3 things haha
[27/11/20, 10:38:39 pm] Jacob: yep
[27/11/20, 10:38:50 pm] Sneha RMIT: We dont have much time
[27/11/20, 10:39:00 pm] Sneha RMIT: What is the best course of action
[27/11/20, 10:40:28 pm] Jacob: i think the best course of action is to work on the final page with the following headings:
[27/11/20, 10:41:26 pm] Jacob: im going to write them as h1, h2, h3 as i did in the a3 draft file
[27/11/20, 10:42:10 pm] Sneha RMIT: Sorry jake I didn’t follow
[27/11/20, 10:42:33 pm] Sneha RMIT: You mean keep following and using the headings as is
[27/11/20, 10:42:36 pm] Jacob: h1 overview, h2 topic, h2 motivation, h2 landscape
[27/11/20, 10:42:45 pm] Sneha RMIT: Ya ya
[27/11/20, 10:42:48 pm] Sneha RMIT: Got it
[27/11/20, 10:42:51 pm] Sneha RMIT: Thanks
[27/11/20, 10:42:51 pm] Jacob: cool
[27/11/20, 10:43:52 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: Sneha, I could add minutes of meeting for only one team meeting 🙁
[27/11/20, 10:43:55 pm] Jacob: h1 detailed description, h2 aims, h2 plans and progress h3 what we will do, h3 how we will do it
[27/11/20, 10:47:50 pm] Jacob: h2 roles, h2 scopes and limits, h2 tools and technology, h2 testing, h2 timeframe, h2 risks, h2 group processes and communications
[27/11/20, 10:48:20 pm] Jacob: hopefully that makes sensem it's a bit confusing, but it is on the assement document too
[27/11/20, 10:48:35 pm] Sneha RMIT: What do you mean?
[27/11/20, 10:48:49 pm] Sneha RMIT: Document not working
[27/11/20, 10:52:23 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: No. My laptop freezing , restarted many times
[27/11/20, 10:53:27 pm] Sneha RMIT: Oh ok
[27/11/20, 10:53:47 pm] Sneha RMIT: Lets see how we go with time
[27/11/20, 10:53:57 pm] Sneha RMIT: I’ll do it if i can
[27/11/20, 10:56:02 pm] Rajaneesh Nair: I’m doing  for meeting 24/11/2020
[27/11/20, 10:57:08 pm] Jacob: i updated the other 'tools' section and i don't think we need to stress about including it on the website
[27/11/20, 10:58:01 pm] Jacob: if you want, i can try to add it to the about page, where it would kind of fit because it is about us and our process
[27/11/20, 11:04:19 pm] Jacob: sneha, can i delete the yellow stuff and convert the document to a pdf now?
[27/11/20, 11:05:02 pm] Sneha RMIT: Yup go for it
