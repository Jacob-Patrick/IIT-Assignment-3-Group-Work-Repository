			<p> An undertaking of this size requires significant collaboration and cooperation between a large number of people with a vast array of different skills, both technical and non-technical in nature. We will need people with knowledge and expertise in the specific software, languages, visual and audio tools necessary for this project. We will need people on team who excel in creativity, innovation, teamwork, leadership, managerial and coordination skills.   </p>

			<p> Supposing a group of venture capitalists were to fund development of this project, we would assemble a team to take our project to the next phase. A suitable team would consist of a project manager, lead programmer, head of art/animation, sound engineer and writer. These 4 members of the team will all work under directions of the project manager and game designer and in turn will be in charge of their own teams and outsourcing tasks to assist in meeting objectives.   </p>


			<b> Project Manager </b>
			<p> The project manager is responsible for developing and maintaining the project plan. The project plan will need to include the scope, scheduling, budget, risks, quality, human resources, procurement requirements, and document assumptions and decisions. The project manager must be informed on all elements of the project and is responsible for consulting with stakeholders and sponsors, as well as leading the members of the project team. The success of the project is dependent on the project manager facilitating the necessary outcomes required to reach completion.  </p>
