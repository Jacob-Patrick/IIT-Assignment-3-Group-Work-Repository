			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="a">
			<p><b>Do you play for escape? Challenge? Connection?</b></p>
			<p><b>Have you ever played games that immersed you so deeply that you came away thinking and feeling differently about life? </b></p>
			</div class="a">
			
			<br>
			<p><u>Overview:</u></p>
			<p> We Pseudo Boomers strive to provide a gaming experience that can foster mental health and wellbeing, enhance social connectedness and help people flourish through challenge, immersion and flow.   </p>
			<p> The purpose of creating this video game is to highlight the prevailing issue of mental health within our wider community today. Our game, The Demon inside a portrayal of a young woman of courage and her ongoing battle with her inner psychological demons, namely anxiety, her depressive demonic spirit and the loss sense of hope and despair. The game intends to provide the user with an immersive experience, rather than simply providing a boring stock standard interactive form of storytelling. The Demon Inside invokes a starkly different style of experience for the player, where they step into the imaginary world of the character, enact being the heroine, step into the character’s shoes and are made to feel that they are in fact battling their mental demons unconsciously.  </p>
			<p> The story progresses with the heroine Amilia trying to live life day-by-day as a normal functioning member of society but continuously disturbed by a voice constantly in the back of her mind, creating distorted troublesome images which bring back painful memories and continue to spiral her down further into a state of disrepair. The objective of having Amilia mental state shown as strong and seemingly fine in the initial stage of the game, is to portray the fragility of one’s mind using this very interactive medium.    </p>
			<br>
			<img width="610" height="300"  src="demons in the mind pic 5.jpg" alt="demons in the mind pic 5"/>
			<br>
			<p>  By creating a false sense of security and control, the idea is to dive the player into the shoes of a very lost individual. Thereafter, the story progresses as Amilia fights to gain control over what she believes to be real.  The player is unconsciously shaped through visual images and sounds explored with the gaming journey that build a mode where the character is constantly questioning everything that is going on in the world in front around them. The trippy key question then becomes...what is real, and what is just fragments of one’s imagination?  </p>
			
			<p><u>Motivation:</u></p>
			<p>  The main motivation behind this game comes from the personal experiences of our group members. We all have either firsthand experienced some form of mental trauma and/or anxiety or have been touched by the deterioration of the mental health of our loved ones. One of our team members, Sneha is also a provisional psychologist and frequently interacts with many young adults who are faced with anxiety or depression in their lives. In the initial phase of planning and discussing ideas around the table, we as a team came to the common consensus that our goal was not to simply create another game, but rather a means of spreading a crucial message to young adults of the stigma of mental health and getting professional psychological assistance. We strongly believe that the issue of mental health now more than ever has become a key concern in our society one that requires immediate attention.  Pseudo Boomers wanted to create a platform where these experiences of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, psychosis and generally ‘not fitting in’ could be translated into an interactive game, a place where an individual can gain insight of how sufferers of mental illness and anxiety feel, but also to promote the idea that these individuals don’t need to feel not alone. We want it to be a place to promote and destigmatise these issues to non-sufferers.  </p>
			<p> Video Games are a medium that we believe is severely underused when it comes to the portrayal of mental illness. As a story telling medium, Video Games can create scenes and scenarios that are unique in storytelling, especially when being compared to mediums such as novels, movies and tv shows. Being able to create choices, follow your own path in a story, and build your own story based on environmental interactions are something that can truly only be brought to fruition using video games.   </p>
			<img width="610" height="400"  src="project motivation.jpg" alt="project motivation"/>
			<br>
			
			<p><u>Landscape:</u></p>
			<p> We take inspiration from the varying portrayals of mental illness that is present in pop culture today. This includes but is not limited to characters and portrayals seen in the likes of Alice in Wonderland by CS Lewis, the Joker from the Batman franchise, and the movie Fight Club, just to name a few.   </p>
			<p> Other games of this genre do exist, and some have particularly caught our eye and creative edge when portraying difficult topics such as mental illness. The best example of this that springs to mind is a game called Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (Ninja Theory, 2017). Hellblade covers mental illness from a very forefront position, using constant chatter and ramblings to full effect to help portray a heroine fraught with pain and suffering. This game was an experience, as it considered a medium as confronting as mental illness and loss, using this medium to create an experience that has been rarely seen in the video game industry to date.  </p>
			<p> The point of difference between other games of this genre, such as Dark Souls, The Last of Us and Celeste (10 Video Games That Deal With Mental Illness, 2020) is that these games occur in fantasy settings or post-apocalyptic realms, whereas our game occurs in an ordinary, everyday, real life setting, intended to highlight the struggles of people as they appear naturally.   </p>
			<br>
			
			<h2><p><b>Detailed Descriptions </p></b></h2> 
			<p><u>Aims:</u></p>
			<p> The aim of this project is to create a video game that allures players to fully immerse into a unknown world of the suffering mind of a person dealing with mental illness. It is with this full immersion that we hope to create a place of understanding and at the same time promote awareness and reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues.   </p>
			<p> To achieve this aim, we have devised three specific goals:   </p>
			<p> Firstly, to achieve full immersion, we want to get inside the head of the character using 360-degree sound to replicate the constant and incessant ‘chatter’ of the inner voice. We want to hear the inner thoughts, background noise of the brain and ears, as well as the voice of any internal ‘demons’ they may be facing at that time.  </p>
			<p> The second way we intend to achieve full immersion and ‘get inside the head’ of somebody suffering from mental health issues is by manipulating the power of choice. Giving players a choice is a staple for a well-constructed single player campaign, but we intend to give the player false or misleading options, designed to replicate the poor decision making and perceived futility of trying to do the right thing of a person suffering from these conditions.   </p>
			<p> The third goal of the project is to create a dark, moody, dimly lit environment to build a level of tension and loneliness as perceived by the heroine, who in contrast appears to the viewer, at least early in the game to be an ordinary, content, almost happy looking person. This is to highlight to the player that people who are suffering from these mental health issues may look perfectly normal and healthy, when in fact they are putting on their best brave face to the world of darkness they perceive around them.  </p>
			<br>
			
			<h2><p><b>Plans and Progress </p></b></h2>  
			<p><u>Detailed Description:</u></p>
			<img width="610" height="250"  src="demons in the mind pic 2.jpg" alt="demons in the mind pic 2"/>
			<br>
			<p> The concept is that our protagonist lives a modern, city life, with an office job. Setting the character’s background life - She is a single mother who lives with her elderly parents who stay at home and look after her children while she works long hard days to put food on the table for her family.  The setting should be representative of a loving household, who do what they can to make ends meet and battle through life putting on a brave face.   </p>
			<p> The initial setup would be our protagonist arguing with her family, creating initial tension before stepping out of the house for the day’s work. This is where we catch a fleeting glimpse of her demon for the first time. The demon will be portrayed as a small crouching creature rested on her shoulder. The demon is omnipresent, yet with varying levels strength, energy and visibility. At times of crisis and weakness, it will be more visible and more vocal and have more influence over her decisions.  </p>
			<p> Throughout the experience, the demon, and in particular the demon’s voice will act as the main antagonist. The idea is that the further you progress through the story, the more surreal the voice and its questions will become. As a player, you will be fully immersed in these events and witness the degradation of the protagonist's mind as she faces the demon through everyday life. What starts out as a rough morning dealing with a familial argument leads to full blown mental breakdown and psychosis as she battles with the voice in her head.   </p>
			<p> The idea for this game would make use of low-lit environments, and specific lighting-based cues to build tension and create an environment of darkness and loneliness that will play heavily into the game’s overall feel. Having this lighting functionality available right out of the box with Unreal Engine means that the game can really show off it’s true, dark, colours.   </p>
			<p> As far as in game mechanics go, the constant chatter from the demon would be a focal point of the game, utilising 360-degree sound to try to replicate the ‘voice in your head’. We will hear only a singular voice, but it will not always be apparent whose voice it is – the inner voice of our protagonist or the voice of the demon.  The voice isn’t always going to be totally negative either, there will be moments where it can be somewhat motivational, at points in the story when the player is slowly getting through a hard time or has succeeded at something. It is normal for people to praise themselves after all. But this can also then be used against the player, to create situations that might feel as though certain decisions will lead towards a better outcome than what will actually be presented.  </p>
			<p> The second feature in the game is the manipulation of free will and power of choice. The false choices and misleading questions as provided by the demon are to be designed in a way that is not entirely ‘fair’ For example, forcing decisions at critical points in the story and offering only options with destructive outcomes of varying degree when other perfectly rational options exist that cause no harm, or having the player select from a set of options that have a mix of good and bad responses, where if the ‘good’ responses are selected, the voice comes back and changes the decision, or initiates a terrible outcome.   </p>
			<p> Finally, as a counterpart to the, 'choice’ element of the game, the game will have multiple different outcomes depending on the decisions made by the player. This will be akin to a ‘choose your own adventure’ story, but in this instance, the choices are being constantly manipulated and the player will need to determine the best course of action, as filtered through the lens of the demon of the character. This will not only assist with replayability of the game, but also opens the game up for further, more permanent, and pivotal story points.    </p>
			<p> The outcome of a playthrough will be of the player’s creation, determined by the players choices throughout the whole game. The intended impact is for the player to have a further understanding into the mind of somebody suffering from mental illness.  </p>
			
			<p><u>How we will do it:</u></p>
			<p>  The game industry is extremely large and growing drastically with the help of virtual reality and Artificial Intelligence. Creation of ‘The Demon Inside’ game is a challenging project because it involves various complex stages from game design to game development, including programming, coding, audio visual engineering, testing and publishing This methodological structure will transform the project ideas into reality though different game development stages.  </p>
				
			<br>
			<img width="610" height="430" src="scope of game design.jpg" alt="scope of game design" />
			<br>	
				
				<ul>
			<p><u><i> Stage 1 – Project Planning  </i></u></p>
			<li> This is the foundation of ‘The Demon Inside’ project. We will ask questions and discuss elements of the game, such as, the type of game; explain the story of the game; determine key features; create characters; determine the intended audience of the game; determine the required hardware and software; begin to scout for and hire talented and experienced developers and other team members, including project managers, sound engineers and art designers; and estimate the cost and timeframe of the project to finish. This process will help the designers, developers and artists to understand the purpose of this project.      </li>
				
			<p><u><i> Stage 2 – Preparing Game Design Document (GDD)  </i></u></p>	
			<li> The Game Design Document will be the skeleton of this project and will contain the overall vision. It will help the members of this project to make their ideas more concrete, understand the duties and development procedures and understand the overall vision and scope of the project. The GDD will help to reduce confusion about the project work by helping to organize project ideas and serve as a to-do list. It will help members to more easily identify if we are missing something and assist the technical team to track the game development cycle.   </li>	
			
			<p><u><i> Stage Three – Production of ‘The Demon Inside’   </i></u></p>
			<li>  This is the most critical stage, where we will start game development and reshape or polish ideas. In this stage, all the team members will work together to develop the game. Audio visual artists, animation artists, sound engineers, developers, producers, team leaders and project managers will play a significant role here. Success of this project is depending on their hard work and contributions. In the production stage, animation artists and designers will give the shape to all the characters, and sound engineers will make audio according to game context. Developers will give life to the heroine and the demon in the story by coding. The production stage consumes plenty of time, as it is the most complex part of game development process.   </li>
			
			<p><u><i> Stage Four – Testing   </i></u></p>
			<li>  The purpose of this project is to develop the first chapter of ‘The Demon Inside’ successfully and the vison of the project is to attract investors to fund the build to completion. This will be achieved by providing an outstanding gaming experience and full immersion, with the help of enjoyable interactive features without any errors or crashes. The testing process is an unavoidable stage in the game development process because testing will help to remove errors including bugs and it will also increase the customer satisfaction. The testing stage will help to develop and publish an error-free game.   </li>
			
			<p><u><i> Stage Five – Marketing   </i></u></p>
			<li>  After achieving a complete and thoroughly tested first chapter of the game, our marketing team members will develop effective marketing strategies to inform potential financial backers about ‘The Demon Inside’ and its unique features through advertisements on social media, websites, YouTube, and other appropriate mediums. Once finance is secured, we can begin planning the next phase of the project, which will be to build a complete and polished game based on this initial chapter.    </li>
				</ul>
				
			
			<h2><p><b>Roles </p></b></h2>
			<p> Roles for team members have been, for the most part, undefined and interchangeable. As a group, we find that we are not always all available to complete the required tasks at certain times. We do tentatively assign tasks to different members, but it is not uncommon for other team members to jump in and help where needed. Having said that, some tentative roles to carry out completion of this project based on work completed so far, interests, and skill sets could be as follows:   </p>
			<br>
			<li> Ben – Game Designer    </li>
			<li>  Jake - Project Manager/Writer    </li>
			<li>  Sneha – Web Developer   </li>
			<li>  Raj – Animation Artist      </li>
			<li>  Murray – Technical advisor and testing    </li>
			
			
			<h2><p><b>Scope and Limits </p></b></h2>
			<p><b>  The proposed project will be broken into 2 stages:   </b></p>
			<p><b><u>   Stage 1  </u></b></p>
			<p> In Stage 1 of the project, we will create just one scene of the game, a snippet of the first chapter, or level of the game in basic format. This will be in order to demonstrate a proof of concept to potential financial investors. To achieve this, we will build a level that is playable, but with features restricted to only those that will demonstrate our goal, using the three specific aims as described in the ‘Aims’ section of this document. Amilia will not, at this stage be able to fully explore the map and will be limited to only being able to interact with a few objects, necessary to demonstrate the game mechanics.   </p>
			<p> In Stage 1, game participants will be able to play as Amilia as she leaves her house to go about her day.  We will see the demon of anxiety sitting on her shoulder and hear his voice of constant chatter injecting unwanted thoughts into her mind and making it impossible to make reasonable decisions.    </p>
			
			<p><b><u>   Stage 2  </u></b></p>
			<p>  In Stage 2 of the project the marketing team will be deployed to secure finance to fund the completion of the game. They will aim to take the single level that has been built in stage 1 and get it in front of the eyes of as many potential investors as possible. This will involve launching social media campaigns and other suitable marketing strategies, preparing a video presentation and seeking active involvement in video game conventions, competitions and other events around the world. </p>
			
			<h3><p><b>Limitations of Scope </p></b></h3>
			<p><b>Factors likely to impact the project scope:  </b></p>
			<p> Scope creep-this occurs when changes are added to the project scope without considering the effects on time, budget or resources. It can be a result of misinterpreting the project scope, the scope being poorly defined, not gaining appropriate client approval, or allowing some stakeholders too much say.    </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Budget</b> -if the budget is not planned effectively, not reported accurately, or not approved it can impact the scope.</li>
				<li><b>Time</b> -if the timeframe planed for the project is subject to change, this will impact the scope.</li>
				<li><b>Quality</b>-if the requirements for quality control are changed by the buyer or sponsor, or as a result of other changes, for example time or cost, this will affect the scope. </li>
				<li><b>Organisational changes</b> -any changes to the structure, direction or strategy of an organisation, such as an election or change in government, can result in the requirements of a project changing, or in some circumstances a project being cancelled altogether. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>Problem areas likely to be encountered in scope management:   </b></p>
			<p> Scope creep-when changes are added to the project scope it will result in an impact on either the time, cost or quality of the project. The management of the scope will be affected due to at least one of these factors requiring adjustment fit in the additional changes  </p>
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Communication</b>-if the communication between the project team, stakeholders and sponsors is not effective and documented accurately, it can result in poor management of the scope.  </li>
				<li> <b>Roles and responsibilities</b>-lack of defined roles and responsibilities around tasks or authorisation processes can lead to oversights occurring throughout the different stages of the project. This will limit the project manager’s ability to stay informed of any issues which may arise.  </li>
				<li> <b>Scheduling</b>-itis important for scheduling to be monitored constantly to be able to adequately plan for any upcoming changes.  </li>
				<li> <b>Risk planning</b>-if the risk management plan has not identified all risks and provided adequate contingency factors, the management of the scope could encounter obstacles for which it is not prepared.  </li>
				<li> <b>Limitation of time</b> -within the given timeframe to complete this assessment, the scope  </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2><p><b>Tools and Technologies  </p></b></h2>
			<p><b>  Software   </b></p>
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Unreal Engine</b>-if the communication between the project team, stakeholders and sponsors is not effective and documented accurately, it can result in poor management of the scope.  </li>
				<li> <b>Microsoft Teams</b>-lack of defined roles and responsibilities around tasks or authorisation processes can lead to oversights occurring throughout the different stages of the project. This will limit the project manager’s ability to stay informed of any issues which may arise.  </li>
				<li> <b>Microsoft Word/PowerPoin</b>-Word processing and internal presentations.  </li>
				<li> <b>WhatsApp </b> Is used for quick direct messages and general team chat. </li>
				<li> <b>GitHub </b> </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>  License  </b></p>
			<ul>
			<li> <b>Texture and Resource Packs</b> - The assets in engine will be derived from premade texture and resource packs to build the game more efficiently. Purchasing and using these will come at a cost but will save in time. </li>
			<li> <b>Office 365 </b>  - The assets in engine will be derived from premade texture and resource packs to build the game more efficiently. Purchasing and using these will come at a cost but will save in time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>  Hardware  </b></p>
			<ul>
			<li> <b>Powerful PC</b>  - The PC’s used for the game development will have to all be running dedicated graphics cards and have specs sufficient enough to render efficiency real-time in engine.  </li>
			<li> <b>Laptop</b> - Would be used when working out of office. Should be powerful enough to be able to do light rendering and in engine work. </li>
			<li> <b>Audio recording equipment </b></li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2><p><b>Testing  </p></b></h2>
			<p> A Quality Assurance Team (QA) will be formed with the purpose of play testing the game to see if they run into any bugs or software crashes. The team will be used at various points along the development path to test as we go along so that it is more manageable than if we just wait for the end and then test the whole thing. Ironing out issues early on will lead to a smoother and quicker development cycle with a much more polished end product.   </p>
			<p> Once it has passed the QA team a Beta built will be shared with the community (Friends/fans) who will be able to get early access to the game so they can test and provide reports on bugs/errors. Opening up the testing to a wider audience will in essence cast a wider net, increasing the probability of finding issues and fixing them before a public release.   </p>
			<p>  The QA team will also still be in place after public launch of the game so that they can resolve any issues that still might be in the software.  </p>
			
			
			<h2><p><b>Timeframe  </p></b></h2>
			<p><b>  The projects estimated delivery time is approximately 14 months from start of project.   </b></p>
			<ul>
			<li> The project planning stage was started in October 2020;  </li>
			<li>  Preparation of the game design document began in November 2020; </li>
			<li>  Game production will begin in December of 2020; </li>
			<li> Final testing is expected to begin in September of 2021;   </li>
			<li> Marketing expected to commence on 1st of January 2022;  </li>
			<li>  Marketing will continue until financial backing is secured, when next phases can occur;  </li>
			</ul>
			
			<img width="600" height="650" src="timeframe.jpg" alt="timeframe" />
			<br>
			
			
			<h2><p><b>Risks  </p></b></h2>
			<p>  Pseudo Boomers have identified the following risks which could affect the delivery of the project if not managed correctly. The Risk Management Plan will be reviewed regularly to add or remove any risks which change throughout the duration of the project.   </p>
			<ol>
			<li> It may take 24 to 36 months to develop and test this game because it requires audio- visual- 3D graphic creativity, art and design and a story to make this game. So, this project requires a high level of strategies and planning.   </li>
			<li>  Change of investors decisions, resulting in a renegotiation between parties  </li>
			<li> Our goal is to develop ‘The Demon Inside’ for different platforms and operating systems and that will create new challenges. So, this project needs highly talented, experienced developers who know best how to make games by writing code, designing, developing and testing to make this game look, feel and play beautifully.   </li>
			<li>  Approval delays  </li>
			<li> Increased cost due to unforeseen changes to scope or time.   </li>
			<li> Lack of skill shortage, or risk of employees leaving, risk of union strikes, or issues with employers' solvency   </li>
			<li> Project development required to use custom made materials like soundtracks and background themes and that will increase the cost. Generally, game developers and publishers rarely use stock images, templates and audio materials.   </li>
			<li>  Requires substantially a large investment to cover the cost of planning, pre-production, production, testing, launch and post-production of this project. So, this project requires highly efficient leaders and project managers to plan this game project and schedule the budget from the project plans.  </li>
			<li> Quality Assurance engineers who are involved in this project need to make sure that this project was made and meet the requirements and it is user-friendly and understandable to the user.   </li>
			<li>  Powerfully effective marketing and advertising strategies are required to launch this project.  </li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<h2><p><b>Group processes and communications    </p></b></h2>
			<p>  Communication with internally within the team, Pseudo Boomers schedule weekly face-to-face meetings to discuss project planning and progress. However, given that we are a technology company where a large segment of our team is located interstate from one another and the ever-increasing uncertainty of the status of lockdowns and state borders, we have improvised and opted to utilise some online technologies for our communications. The team have chosen to meet formally by scheduling a meeting once a week via MS Teams, where we also utilise the cloud storage and document sharing facilities.  </p>
			<p>  Within the direct game development team, Pseudo Boomers use a WhatsApp chat group for the bulk of our day-to-day communications, less formal discussions and progress reports. We acknowledge that living across time zones and leading very busy and varied lifestyles makes it difficult for us to all be present at each meeting and so we make use of recording meetings for later viewing and further clarification of topics discussed via WhatsApp.  </p>
			<p> In the instance of group members not responding to communications, we again acknowledge that not everybody may be able to respond in a certain time frame and unless an absence has been notified prior, we generally accept that we have 48 hours to respond, after which we may start to send personal emails and if these are not responded to within another 24 hours, we will make phone calls, after which we will start to reassign tasks.   </p>
			
			<h3><p><b>Project Management application tools  </p></b></h3>
			<p>We could have utilised alternative, formative consistent means of tracking and communicating project progress for Pseudo Boomers using Project Management application tools:   </p>
			<p><i>MS project</i> - Microsoft product with customised built-in templates designed to assist a project manager in developing a project plan, assigning resources to tasks, tracking progress, managing the budget and analysing workloads. It is suitable for all industries.    </p>
			<p><i>Jira</i> - part of Atlassian Issue and Tracking Software often used by agile methodology companies. It offers number of features such as project progress tracking, assigning resources to tasks, customized workflows, worklog tracking and creating reports. It can be integrated with other Atlassian tools that are already used by a company.  </p>
			<p><i>Asana</i> - application designed to improve team collaboration and work management. Can be used to create projects, assign work to project team members, specify deadlines, and communicate about tasks directly in it. It also includes reporting tools, file attachments and calendars  </p>
