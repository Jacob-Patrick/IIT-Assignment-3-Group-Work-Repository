			<p> <b><i> Benjamin Saar </i></b> (Ben) is 23 years old and lives in the Dandenong Ranges just east of Melbourne, Victoria. He is currently working as a Service Technician for an IT company in Melbourne and has been doing so for just shy of two years. He has spent many years of his life playing a multitude of sports. He played soccer for around 18 years, only stopping when he started full-time work. From an IT perspective however, he has always had an avid passion for technology. Whether it be messing with bits of hardware and building PC’s or just playing games, technology has always been there. Working in a more technical space and getting to work in a business environment has really opened his eyes to the limitless possibilities that IT has, and how it can be used to make life easier for all.

			<p> <b><i>Murray Nesteroff</i></b> lives in the Inner West in Sydney, NSW. His first professional role was at a butcher shop for 5 years, where he learnt a few things about life. It took him a while to realise that it wasn’t for him and after a few other jobs, including working at a Samsung mobile store, he landed at the telco that he is currently work for. His interests include sport, photography and travelling. He loves spending time in the country away from the busy city just to recharge. He has had an avid interest in IT ever since he built his first gaming PC at a young age. Murray believes that IT is an amazingly broad industry with incredible opportunities, and he can’t think of making his profession in any other field.

There, she completed a Bachelor of Justice and an Advanced Diploma in Business Management. She took up a career in Information Technology after majoring in Psychology. Sneha’s perspective on life is that “you can never be too small or too big for anything, if you set your mind on achieving those goals”, and as if her life were not busy enough already, she decided to take one step further and challenge herself by enrolling back into university with the Bachelor of Information Technology.

			<p> <b><i>Test Results</i></b>
			<p>As part of our first assignment in Introduction to IT, we each undertook three online personality tests, with the aim of helping us to identify our behavior when forming and interacting in a team. We all participated in a Myers-Briggs Type Test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">here</a>; a Learning Type Test <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">here</a> and a third test of our choosing. Sneha chose to do the Big 5 Personality test found <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">here</a>, Jacob and Rajaneesh chose to do a Leadership Test at <a href="https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz">here</a>; Murray took a Creativity Test <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">here</a>; and Sneha also took a Human metrics Jung Typology Test <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp">here</a>.  </p>
</p>
<p>Full results and detailed analysis and comparisons of our test results can be seen at  <a href="https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository/Team%20Career%20Psychological%20Test%20Results.html">Our Assignment 2 Website</a></p>
			<br>
			<p> <b><i>Group Processes</i></b>
			<br>
			<p> We as a group are pleased with our efforts in Assignment 2 and feel that our strength lies in our good communication, positivity, determination and flexibility. We developed some useful tools and techniques that will be employed in the assignment 3 process too. These include using a working to-do-list to keep up to date with what tasks need to be completed and who is working on what and staying in touch with each other via our highly active WhatsApp group chat. We have learned from our previous assignment to not underestimate the task of converting our report to website form and will setup a GitHub repository and work on the website from an earlier stage.   </p>

			<br>
			<p> <b><i>Career Plans</i></b>
			<br>
			<p> Unsurprisingly from a group of IT students, we are all pursuing careers that require a certain level of technical expertise. A few differences are apparent too, namely that Sneha has chosen managerial/leadership roles. This is not surprising given her natural leadership skills as demonstrated by their career experience and personality test results.   </p>
			<p> While a lot of these positions may be performed remotely and may include elements of remote work, Jake was the only group member to choose a specifically remote position. Murray and Sneha were the only members to choose positions with a heavy focus on customer service. </p>
			<p> Our specific career plans all involve further training and experience. Some common elements to our career plans include: continuing the Bachelor of IT to completion; learning specific tools, coding languages and techniques; further training and education including specific technical certificates and managerial certificates; and gaining industry experience through either relevant current employment, entry level IT jobs or internships.  </p>
