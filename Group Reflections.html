			<p> We are very comfortable working with each other now, and understand each other’s strengths, weaknesses and skillsets. We had a bit of a different dynamic this time, especially after we lost Jordan at the critical time, but we quickly and fluidly spread the workload and filled his position and still managed to get the assignment done on time, which was great.  </p>
			<p> I experienced a bit of panic at the start, not knowing how to start the assignment. This could be improved again by starting earlier, having some better meeting skills, and clearly defining our project aim and scope from the start and making sure that we are all confident knowing our roles. I was quite surprised by the way I handled working from somebody else's project idea, and I really warmed to it. It was nice to experience the transition from individual projects to feel truly part of a team working for a common cause. I learned this time how dynamic groups need to be, changing roles when required, and each taking a turn to lead and motivate the group.   </p>

			<p><b>	(2) Raj </b></p>
			<p> Being part of this great team is a phenomenal feeling. Faced more challenges and obstacles than before and everyone worked harder than previous group assignment 2. Even though when one of our team members Jordan withdrawn from this course, we managed to overcome the situations by teamwork.  Everyone took the responsibility in their shoulders to complete this assignment on time with perfection. I think, strength of my team is effective communication and engagements. Everyone did their best to attend the meetings on Microsoft Team, all my team members accepted the differences and helped each other to clarify and recognize the challenges of the tasks to achieve the goal, didn’t hesitated to appreciate for a team member’s hard work or contribution.   </p>
			<p> Good communication is the strength of my team; team members are extremely happy to express their ideas, suggestions and asking and giving feedbacks from the beginning. Regular meetings through Microsoft team, chats through WhatsApp increased the team productivity. Bonding between team members became stronger during this group activity.    </p>
			<p> My team members taught me how to work with someone’s project. All my team members are rich with their hardworking, dedication, and pleasant attitude and a helping heart!  Everyone took outstanding efforts to know each other.  Everyone was clear about their role in this group activities and they contributed their part on time with perfection, work together superbly to accomplish great results. Everyone is so generous to share the workload and that made things bit easy. Great thing is that none of them are bookworms; they are a bunch of funny and joyous people, that reduced the stress of teamwork. I feel so proud to work with a supportive, friendly, target oriented team like this. I learned about how beneficial is to work with team members from diverse background.   </p>
			
			<p><b>	(3) Murray </b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>I think the group did a really good job of coming together quickly and was nice to find out that the group was awesome.</li>
			<li>Everyone was quick to put their hands up to do work, so it made it easy in terms of organising the workload. </li>
			<li>Next time I would like to get a to do list going earlier in the project would have been good as it is always nice ticking things off a list. </li>
			<li>I think we should have probably had organised all the Teams meetings at the start and can be recorded and attended by those that can make it. </li>
			<li>I was surprised with how busy everyone in the group is outside of uni. Was comforting to know I wasn’t the only one. </li>
			<li>I was surprised how close the group got so quickly! Getting to know each member on a more personal level was really rewarding. Specially in these times of Covid19.</li>
			<li>I think this assignment was a good first step in getting to know our group and the small ways we can improve. More importantly though we found how strong we are as a group and have gained the confidence we need to ace this and future assignments.</li>

			<p><b>	(4) Sneha </b></p>
			<p> Working with this team over the last couple of assessments has really brought us close together, and I feel we are at a stage where we are in our element, we work well together, we comfortable with each together and understand where each one on of us are at. This feeling is quite important to have as it builds good rapport and trust and allows team members to feel comfortable enough to be honest and open when faced with stressors and struggling to cope with the workload.   </p>
			<p> Quite noticeably one good quality our team has to offer would be the way we collaborate and are able to recognise everyone's strengths and weaknesses. Very early on into this assessment, we focused our energy on planning what needed to be done, structuring the content, and assisting each other when one of us was struggling to complete a task. There never has been any issues of conflict, power struggle between team members, which is why when one of our team members announced that he had decided to discontinue the course and all team members were sympathetic and understanding of his decision and the reasons for it.   </p>
			<p> Changes in restructure of the team dynamics at the last stage just before the assessment was due, put added pressure on the team. One of our team members, Jordan who was part of our previous team exited the course in less than two weeks before submission of this project. Also, another team member, Murray faced challenges managing between personal family issues, work and university commitments of this assessment and couldn’t follow through completing assigned work. Rest of the team members found themselves in a situation where they now were time pressed, additional work now needed to be distribution, and other unaccounted non-related university issues (I.e., job pressure to meet deadlines, family commitments and parenting obligations, exhaustion from the monotonous constant routine also creeped up.  This impacted team members emotionally in some way or form, finding themselves at points where they felt demoralised or demotivated to continue to push themselves to get the task at hand completed, and always actively participating and communicating the rate of progress of tasks.   </p>
			<p> However, in saying overall I am truly impressed with the on-going communication on WhatsApp regardless of individuals being in different locations with varying time zones (Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth). This project has provided me the opportunity to learn the need of understanding compassion, willing to go the extra mile and pushing through to meet deadlines when push comes to shove.   </p>
			
 			<p><b>	(5) Ben </b></p>
			<p> This group has continued to be awesome to work in conjunction with as we moved forward into the later stages of the term. That isn’t to say we haven’t run into our fair share of problems that we have had to overcome, but in the end, I am more than satisfied by how we have managed to come together and complete the final stages of this assignment.   </p>
			<p> Communication between the group continued to be great, with messaging back and forth with plans laid out early in the piece so that we all understood where we were going and who was contributing to what area. This dynamic did change somewhat as we moved on and each became busier with multiple daily life commitments. We started getting caught up a lot with matters external to University that did make for a challenging experience, with team members having health issues, personal work, home dramas and the eventual loss of a team-mate. It has certainly not been a smooth sailing trip.   </p>
			<p> This has meant that as a collective we have really had to re-evaluate our standing with the project, and we managed to pull together to re-align our goals and finish off out the project, riding out to the end of this semester on a high note. This group-based work has really taught us how to work in a team and included the full dynamic that can come to play when working as one.    </p>

			<p> As in assignment 2, the areas that we have excelled in are our communication skills, teamwork and adaptability. We have really started to get to know each other now and continue to marvel at each other's kindness and eagerness to help each other.  	</p>
			<p> We have really started to evolve as a professional team too. We have honed our meeting skills, organisational skills, are more familiar with the technology involved (GitHub, HTML, CSS, etc.), and we carry on with our meetings, regardless of if not all members can attend. We have learned a lot about working within a team and each took a turn as leader at one point or another. We have developed some good skills with academic writing and other professional skills such as project management, leadership and collaborative documentation.  	</p>
			<p> The dynamic has been slightly different this time around, with group members facing increasing pressures from study, work and family commitments, we have had to be more adaptable than ever. The loss of one team member and erratic and busy schedules of others has meant that the workload has felt heavier at times and we have had to constantly reassign and redistribute the load amongst the members that are available at the time. 	</p>
			<p> While we have continued to evolve and better ourselves as a group, there are still some key areas in which we could improve. If we were to get started at the earliest opportunity, it probably would have relieved a lot of pressure from us. While we did set up some meetings early in the piece, we probably would have benefited by prioritising setting a clear definition for the aim and the scope of the project right at the start. As it played out, the segments were completed in a more modular way and we were often changing already completed sections so that they would still fit the context created by newer sections as the project evolved. 	</p>
			<p> At times, this project seemed beyond our grasp, as there was so much going on in our lives. Sickness, hospital visits, holidays, state lockdowns, increasing workloads, family drama, new jobs and engagements, are some of the things that slowed us down with this assignment and those of us that survived till the end are very surprised and proud of each other’s tenacity and dedication to the team. 	</p>
